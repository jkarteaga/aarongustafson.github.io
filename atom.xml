				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the work that we do on the Web (as well as in our daily lives), we’re often confronted, informed, or judged based on averages. I never really stopped to think about it, beyond being bugged by the fact that averages aren’t truly representative of reality. Then I listened to <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-average/">99% Invisible’s episode “On Average”</a>. It was incredibly enlightening and the stories shared in that episode provide sage wisdom that is very relevant to the work that we do.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Do you know where our fascination with averages began? It all started with Adolphe Quételet, a Belgian mathematician and astronomer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the 1830s, astronomers were some of the only people that regularly calculated averages, since early telescopes were extremely imprecise. To obtain more accurate data for say, tracking the orbits of planets, astronomers would take multiple measurements (all of which were slightly different) add them together, then divide by the number of observations to get a better approximation of the true value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quetelet decided to apply this tool to people, starting with Scottish soldiers’ chest sizes. Turns out the average chest size of a Scottish soldier in the 1830s was 39.75 inches. File that one away for Pub Trivia.</p>

<p>Quetelet believed that the average was the “true” size of something… something that we should strive for or that nature would attempt to create. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_idealism">Platonic ideal</a> if you will:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Quetelet’s mind, human averages had a certain moral mandate. By his logic, if everyone were optimally fed and lived under the same environmental conditions, they would be average. And this is what society should be striving for: the continual improvement of the average of the group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We look at averages all the time in our work. Some, like average <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive">Time To Interactive (TTI)</a>, are useful measurements that allow us to improve our work; others, like the “average” user are decidedly less so. <span data-quotable="">The “average” person (or dog or flower) is a myth. Everyone and everything is unique to some equally unique degree.</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_second">Even mass-produced objects have variance</a>.</p>

<p>Designing for the “average” user is incredibly problematic. The episode I mentioned captured this perfectly in a story about the U.S. Army’s design of airplane cockpits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]n 1926, when the Army designed its first airplane cockpit, they measured the physical dimensions of male pilots and calculated the average measurement of their height, weight, arm-length and other dimensions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The results determined the size and shape of the seat, the distance to the pedals and the stick, and even the shape of the flight helmets. This mean that, in part, pilots were selected based on their ability to fit into the cockpit designed for the average 1920s man.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This worked more or less up until World War II, when the Army began recruiting hundreds of new pilots to expand its air forces (which became a separate branch of the military in 1947). But with the birth and expansion of the Air Force came a decline in performance and a rash of deaths. Even with no war, pilots continued to die during training, as they were unable to control their planes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The high death rate in the Air Force was a mystery for many years, but after blaming the pilots and their training programs, the military finally realized that the cockpit itself was to blame, that it didn’t actually fit most pilots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1950, the Air Force sent Gilbert S. Daniels out to collect ten measurements from thousands of airmen—yes, they were all men at the time—across the U.S. in order to establish a new average. After collecting the data, Daniels got curious and decided to see how many of the airmen he measured hit the average on all ten measurements. Not a single one. How about three of the measurements? Less than five percent. He realized that <span data-quotable="">in designing for an average, they were, in fact, designing for no one.</span> Based on this discovery, the Air Force commissioned new equipment that including features like adjustable foot pedals, helmet straps, flight suits, and seats. And, wonder of wonders, pilot performance improved dramatically.</p>

<p>When we design, we need to be cognizant of the variety of human experience and plan accordingly. <span data-quotable="">For our work to be successful, we need to accommodate the adjustments our users require for <em>them</em> to be successful.</span> Responsive layouts, adaptive interfaces, support for assistive technologies… all of these approaches enable our work to go further by enabling it to be tailored to the permanent, temporary, and/or situational needs of our users.</p>

<p>All of this is to say, this episode made me an even more ardent believer in the idea of <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive enhancement</a> and the continuum of experience it enables. You should go listen to it now, I promise there’s more to the story.</p>

				<link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/insert-clickbait-headline-about-progressive-enhancement-here/"/>
				<updated>2016-12-06T14:45:25-05:00</updated>
				<id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/insert-clickbait-headline-about-progressive-enhancement-here</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Late last week, Josh Korr, a project manager at Viget, posted at length about <a href="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">what he sees as a fundamental flaw with the argument for progressive enhancement</a>. In reading the post, it became clear to me that Josh really doesn’t have a good grasp on progressive enhancement or the reasons its proponents think it’s a good philosophy to follow. Despite claiming to be “an expert at spotting fuzzy rhetoric and teasing out what’s really being said”, Josh makes a lot of false assumptions and inferences. My response would not have fit in a comment, so here it is…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Before I dive in, it’s worth noting that Josh admits that he is not a developer. As such, he can’t really speak to the bits where the rubber really meets the road with respect to progressive enhancement. Instead, he focuses on the argument for it, which he sees as a purely moral one… and a flimsily moral one at that.</p>

<p>I’m also unsure as to how Josh would characterize me. I don’t think I fit his mold of PE “hard-liners”, but since I’ve written two books and countless articles on the subject and he quotes me in the piece, I’ll go out on a limb and say he probably thinks I am.</p>

<p>Ok, enough with the preliminaries, let’s jump over to his piece…</p>

<hr />

<p>Right out of the gate, Josh demonstrates a fundamental misread of progressive enhancement. If I had to guess, it probably stems from his source material, but he sees progressive enhancement as a moral argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a moral imperative that everything on the web should be available to everyone everywhere all the time. Failing to achieve — or at least strive for — that goal is inhumane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now he’s quick to admit that no one has ever explicitly said this, but this is his takeaway from the articles and posts he’s read. It’s a pretty harsh, black &amp; white, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You're_either_with_us,_or_against_us"><em>you’re either with us or against us</em></a> sort of statement that has so many people picking sides and lobbing rocks and other heavy objects at anyone who disagrees with them. And everyone he quotes in the piece as examples of why he thinks this is progressive enhancement’s central conceit is much more of an “it depends” sort of person.</p>

<p>To clarify, progressive enhancement is neither moral or amoral. It’s a philosophy that recognizes the nature of the Web as a medium and asks us to think about how to build products that are robust and capable of reaching as many potential customers as possible. It isn’t concerned with any particular technology, it simply asks that we look at each tool we use with a critical eye and consider both its benefits and drawbacks. And it’s certainly not anti-JavaScript.</p>

<p>I could go on, but let’s circle back to Josh’s piece. Off the bat he makes some pretty bold claims about what he intends to prove in this piece:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<ol><li>Progressive enhancement is a philosophical, moral argument disguised as a practical approach to web development.</li><li>This makes it impossible to engage with at a practical level.</li><li>When exposed to scrutiny, that moral argument falls apart.</li><li>Therefore, if PEers can’t find a different argument, it’s ok for everyone else to get on with their lives.</li></ol>
</blockquote>

<p>For the record, I plan to address <em>his</em> arguments quite practically. As I mentioned, progressive enhancement is not solely founded on morality, though that can certainly be viewed as a facet. The reality is that progressive enhancement is quite pragmatic, addressing the Web as it exists not as we might hope that it exists or how <em>we</em> experience it.</p>

<p>Over the course of a few sections—which I wish I could link to directly, but alas, the headings don’t have unique <code>id</code>s—he examines a handful of quotes and attempts to tease out their hidden meaning by following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_School_Admission_Test">LSAT</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning">Logic Reasoning</a> framework. We’ll start with the first one.</p>

<h2 id="working-without-javascript">Working without JavaScript</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<h4>Statement</h4>
<ul><li>“When we write JavaScript, it’s critical that we recognize that we can’t be guaranteed it will run.” — <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/missed-connections/">Aaron Gustafson</a></li><li>“If you make your core tasks dependent on JavaScript, some of your potential users will inevitably be left out in the cold.” —&nbsp;<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/7706">Jeremy Keith</a></li></ul>
<p>Unstated assumptions:</p>
<ul><li><em>Because there is some chance JavaScript won’t run, we must always account for that chance.</em></li><li><em>Core tasks can always be achieved without JavaScript.</em></li><li><em>It is always bad to ignore some potential users for any reason.</em></li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>His first attempt at teasing out the meaning of these statements comes close, but ignores some critical word choices. First off, neither Jeremy nor I speak in absolutes. As I mentioned before, we (and the other folks he quotes) all believe that the right technical choices for a project depend on specifically on the purpose and goals of <em>that specific project</em>. In other words <em>it depends</em>. We intentionally avoid absolutist words like “always” (which, incidentally, Josh has no problem throwing around, on his own or on our behalf).</p>

<p>For the development of <em>most</em> websites, the benefits of following a progressive enhancement philosophy far outweigh the cost of doing so. I’m hoping Josh will take a few minutes to read my post on <a href="http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/the-true-cost-of-progressive-enhancement/">the true cost of progressive enhancement in relation to actual client projects</a>. As a project manager, I hope he’d find it enlightening and useful.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that he’s not considering the reason we make statements like this: Many sites rely 100% on JavaScript without needing to. The reasons why sites (like news sites, for instance) are built to be completely reliant on a fragile technology is somewhat irrelevant. But what isn’t irrelevant is that it happens. Often. That’s why I said “it’s critical that we <em>recognize</em> that we can’t be guaranteed it will run” (emphasis mine). A lack of acknowledgement of JavaScript’s fragility is one of the main problems I see with web development today. I suspect Jeremy and everyone else quoted in the post feels exactly the same. To be successful in a medium, you need to understand the medium. And the (sad, troubling, interesting) reality of the Web is that <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/a-fundamental-disconnect/">we don’t control a whole lot</a>. We certainly control a whole lot less than we often believe we do.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I disagree with his characterization of the argument for progressive enhancement being a moral one. Morality can certainly be one argument for progressive enhancement, and as <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/egalitarianism/">a proponent of egalitarianism</a> I certainly see that. But it’s not the only one. If you’re in business, there are a few really good business-y reasons to embrace progressive enhancement:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Progressive enhancement and accessibility are very closely tied. Whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_the_Blind_v._Target_Corp.">brought by legitimate groups</a> or <a href="http://chrishofstader.com/stop-the-ada-trolls/">opportunists</a>, lawsuits over the accessibility of your web presence can happen; following progressive enhancement <em>may</em> help you avoid them.</li>
  <li><strong>Development Costs:</strong> As I mentioned earlier, progressive enhancement is a more cost-effective approach, especially for long-lived projects. Here’s that link again: <a href="http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/the-true-cost-of-progressive-enhancement/">The True Cost of Progressive Enhancement</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Reach:</strong> The more means by which you enable users to access your products, information, etc., the more opportunities you create to earn their business. Consider that no one thought folks would buy big-ticket items on mobile just a few short years ago. Boy, were they wrong. Folks buy cars, planes, and more from their tablets and smartphones on the regular these days.</li>
  <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> When your site is down, not only do you lose potential customers, you run the risk of losing existing ones too. There have been <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/02/07/gawker-outage-causing-twitter-stir">numerous</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/28/sky-broadband-blocks-jquery-web-critical-plugin">incidents</a> where big sites got hosed due to JavaScript dependencies and they didn’t have a fallback. Progressive enhancement ensures users can always do what they came to your site to do, even if it’s not the ideal experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hmm, no moral arguments for progressive enhancement there… but let’s continue.</p>

<h2 id="some-experience-vs-no-experience">Some experience vs. no experience</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<h4>Statement</h4>
<ul><li>“[With a PE approach,] Older browsers get a clunky experience with full page refreshes, but that’s still much, much better than giving them nothing at all.” — <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/7706">Jeremy Keith</a></li><li>“If for some reason JavaScript breaks, the site should still work and look good. If the CSS doesn’t load correctly, the HTML content should still be there with meaningful hyperlinks.” — <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/progressive-enhancement-past-present-future">Nick Pettit</a></li></ul>
<p>Unstated assumptions:</p>
<ul><li><em>A clunky experience is always better than no experience.</em></li><li><em>HTML content — i.e. text, images, unstyled forms — is the most important part of most websites.</em></li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You may be surprised to hear that I have no issue with Josh’s distillation here. Clunky is a bit of a loaded word, but I agree that <em>an</em> experience <em>is</em> better than no experience, especially for critical tasks like checking your bank account, registering to vote, making a purchase from an online shop. In my book, I talk a little bit about a strange thing we experienced <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/netscape">when <cite>A List Apart</cite> stopped delivering CSS to Netscape Navigator 4</a> way back in 2001:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We assume that those who choose to keep using 4.0 browsers have reasons for doing so; we also assume that most of those folks don’t really care about “design issues.” They just want information, and with this approach they can still get the information they seek. In fact, since we began hiding the design from non–compliant browsers in February 2001, ALA’s Netscape 4 readership has increased, from about 6% to about 11%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Folks come to our web offerings for a reason. Sometimes its to gather information, sometimes it’s to be entertained, sometimes it’s to make a purchase. It’s in our best interest to remove every potential obstacle that can preclude them from doing that. That’s good customer service.</p>

<h2 id="project-priorities">Project priorities</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<h4>Statement</h4>
<ul><li>“Question any approach to the web where fancy features for a few are prioritized &amp; basic access is something you’ll ‘get to’&nbsp;eventually.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/tkadlec/status/565951127225896961">Tim Kadlec</a></li></ul>
<p>Unstated assumptions:</p>
<ul><li><em>Everything beyond HTML content is superfluous fanciness.</em></li><li><em>It’s morally problematic if some users cannot access features built with JavaScript.</em></li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to put words in Tim’s mouth (like Josh is here), but what Tim’s quote is discussing is <a href="https://blog.daftcode.pl/hype-driven-development-3469fc2e9b22#.ly6bqxv9s">hype-driven</a> (as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design">user-centered</a>) design. We (as developers) often <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/who-should-pay/">prioritize our own convenience/excitement/interest over our users’ actual needs</a>. It doesn’t happen all the time (note I said <em>often</em>), but it happens frequently enough to require us to call it out now and again (as Tim did here).</p>

<p>As for the “unstated assumptions”, I know for a fact that Tim would never call “everything beyond HTML” superfluous. What he is saying is that we should <em>question</em>—as in weigh the pros and cons—of each and every design pattern and development practice we consider. It’s important to do this because there are always tradeoffs. Some considerations that should be on your list include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download speed;</li>
  <li>Time to interactivity;</li>
  <li>Interaction performance;</li>
  <li>Perceived performance;</li>
  <li>Input methods;</li>
  <li>User experience;</li>
  <li>Screen size &amp; orientation;</li>
  <li>Visual hierarchy;</li>
  <li>Aesthetic design;</li>
  <li>Contrast;</li>
  <li>Readability;</li>
  <li>Text equivalents of rich interfaces for visually impaired users <em>and</em> headless UIs;</li>
  <li>Fallbacks; and</li>
  <li>Copywriting.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is by no means exhaustive nor is it in any particular order; it’s what came immediately to mind for me. Some interfaces may have fewer or more considerations as each is different. And some of these considerations might be in opposition to others depending on the interface. It’s critical that we consider the implications of our design decisions by weighing them against one another before we make any sort of decision about how to progress. Otherwise we open ourselves up to potential problems and the cost of changing things goes up the further into a project we are:</p>

<figcaption>The cost of changing your mind goes up the further into any project you are. Just ask any contractor you hire to work on your house.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a project manager, I’m sure Josh understands this reality.</p>

<p>As to the “morally problematic” bit, I’ll refer back to <a href="#working-without-javascript">my earlier discussion of business considerations</a>. Sure, morality can certainly be part of it, but I’d argue that it’s unwise to make assumptions about your users regardless. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that all of or users are like us (or like the personas we come up with). My employer, Microsoft, makes a great case for why we should avoid doing this in their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/inclusive">Inclusive Design materials</a>:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think anyone quoted here would argue that the Web (taken in its entirety) is “the sum of all human knowledge”—Nick, I imagine, was using that phrase somewhat hyperbolically. But there is a lot of information on the Web folks should have access too, whether from a business standpoint or a legal one. What Nick, Jeremy, and Brad are really highlighting here is that we often make somewhat arbitrary design &amp; development decisions that can block access to useful or necessary information and interactions.</p>

<p>In my talk <a href="https://vimeo.com/70018634"><em>Designing with Empathy</em></a> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/designing-with-empathy-beyond-tellerrand-2013">slides</a>), I discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_meat_navigation">“mystery meat” navigation</a>. I can’t imagine any designer sets out to make their site difficult to navigate, but we are influenced by what we see (and are inspired by) on the web. Some folks took inspiration from web-based art projects like this Toyota microsite:</p>

<figcaption><a href="http://www.northkingdom.com/cases/i-huvudet-pa-toyota/">On Toyota’s Mind</a> is a classic example of mystery meat navigation. It’s a Flash site and you can navigate when you happen to mouse over "hotspots" in the design. I’m pointing to one with a big red arrow here.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Though probably not directly influenced by On Toyota’s Mind, <a href="https://www.flatbush.org/">Yeshiva of Flatbush</a> was certainly influenced by the concept of “experiential” (which is a polite way of saying “mystery meat”) navigation.</p>

<p>That’s a design/UX example, but development is no different. How many Single Page Apps have you see out there that really didn’t need to be built that way? Dozens? We often put the cart before the horse and decide to build a site using a particular stack or framework without even considering the type of content we’re dealing with or whether that decision is in the best interest of the project or its end users. That goes directly back to <a href="#project-priorities">Tim’s earlier point</a>.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement recognizes that <a href="https://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/read/chapter-1.html#figure-1-2"><strong>experience is a continuum</strong></a> and we all have different needs when accessing the Web. Some are permanent: Low vision or blindness. Some are temporary: Imprecise mousing due to injury. Others are purely situational: Glare when your users are outside on a mobile device or have turned their screen brightness down to conserve battery. When we make our design and development decisions in the service of the project and the users who will access it, everyone wins.</p>

<h2 id="real-answers-to-real-questions">Real answers to real questions</h2>

<p>In the next section, Josh tries to say we only discuss progressive enhancement as a moral imperative. Clearly I don’t (and would go further to say no one else who was quoted does either). He argues that ours is “a philosophical argument, not a practical approach to web development”. I call bullshit. As I’ve just discussed in the previous sections, progressive enhancement is a practical, fiscally-responsible, developmentally robust philosophical approach to building for the Web.</p>

<p>But let’s look at some of the questions he says we don’t answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wait, how often do people turn off JavaScript?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Folks turning off JavaScript isn’t really the issue. It used to be, but that was years ago. I discussed <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/progressive-misconceptions/">the misconception that this is still a concern</a> a few weeks ago. The real issue is whether or not JavaScript is available. Obviously your project may vary, but <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">the UK government pegged their non-JavaScript usage at 1.1%</a>. The more interesting bit, however, was that only 0.2% of their users fell into the “Javascript off or no JavaScript support” camp. 0.9% of their users <em>should have</em> gotten the JavaScript-based enhancement on offer, but didn’t. <a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html">The potential reasons are myriad</a>. JavaScript is great, but you can’t assume it’ll be available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m not trying to be mean, but I don’t think people in Sudan are going to buy my product.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t really a question, but it is the kinda thing I hear every now and then. An even more aggressive and ill-informed version I got was “I sell TVs; blind people don’t watch TV”. As a practical person, I’m willing to admit that your organization probably knows its market pretty well. If your products aren’t available in certain regions, it’s probably not worth your while to cater to folks in that region. But here’s some additional food for thought:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When you remove barriers to access for one group, you create opportunities for others.</strong> A perfect example of this is the curb cut. Curb cuts were originally created to facilitate folks in wheelchairs getting across the road. In creating curb cuts, we’ve also enabled kids to ride bicycles more safely on the sidewalk, delivery personnel to more easily move large numbers of boxes from their trucks into buildings, and parents to more easily cross streets with a stroller. Small considerations for one group pay dividends to more. What rational business doesn’t want to enable more folks to become customers?</li>
  <li><strong>Geography isn’t everything.</strong> I’m not as familiar with specific design considerations for Sudanese users, but since about 97% of Sudanese people are Muslim, let’s tuck into that. Ignoring translations and right-to-left text, let’s just focus on cultural sensitivity. For instance, a photo of a muscular, shirtless guy is relatively acceptable in much of the West, but <a href="http://www.instantshift.com/2015/04/23/website-designs-for-various-cultures/">would be incredibly offensive to a traditional Muslim population</a>. Now your target audience may not be 100% Muslim (nor may your content lend itself to scantily-clad men), but if you are creating sites for mass consumption, knowing this might help you art direct the project better and build something that doesn’t offend potential customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reach is incredibly important for companies and is something the Web enables quite easily. To squander that—whether intentionally or not—would be a shame.</p>

<h2 id="failures-of-understanding">Failures of understanding</h2>

<p>Josh spends the next section discussing what he views as failures of the argument for progressive enhancement. He’s of course, still debating it as a purely moral argument, which I think I’ve disproven at this point, but let’s take a look at what he has to say…</p>

<p>The first “fail” he casts on progressive enhancement proponents is that we “are wrong about what’s actually on the Web.” Josh offers three primary offerings on the Web:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<ul><li>Business and personal software, both of which have exploded in use now that <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software has eaten the world</a> and is accessed primarily via the web</li><li>Copyrighted news and entertainment content (text, photos, music, video, video games)</li><li>Advertising and marketing content</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the fundamental issue with seeing the Web only through the lens of your own experience. Of course he would list software as the number one thing on the Web—I’m sure he uses Basecamp, Harvest, GitHub, Slack, TeamWork, Google Docs, Office 365, or any of a host of business-related Software as a Service offerings every day. As a beneficiary of fast network speeds, I’m not at all surprised that entertainment is his number two: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go/Now… It’s great to be financially-stable and live in the West. And as someone who works at a web agency, of course advertising would be his number three. A lot of the work Viget, and most other agencies for that matter, does is marketing-related; nothing wrong with that. <strong>But the Web is so much more than this.</strong> Here’s just a fraction of the stuff he’s overlooked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eCommerce,</li>
  <li>Social media,</li>
  <li>Banks,</li>
  <li>Governments,</li>
  <li>Non-profits,</li>
  <li>Small businesses,</li>
  <li>Educational institutions,</li>
  <li>Research institutions,</li>
  <li>Religious groups,</li>
  <li>Community organizations, and</li>
  <li>Forums.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s hard to find figures on anything but porn—which incidentally accounts for <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-23030090">somewhere between 4% and 35% of the Web</a>, depending on who you ask—but I have to imagine that these categories he’s overlooked probably account for the vast majority of “pages” on the Web even if they don’t account for the majority of traffic on it. Of course, as of 2014, <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/majority-web-traffic-comes-robots-180950398/">the majority of traffic on the Web was bots</a>, so…</p>

<p>The second “fail” he identifies is that our “concepts of universal access and moral imperatives… make no sense” in light of “fail” number one. He goes on to provide a list of things he seems to think we want even though advocating for progressive enhancement (and even universal access) doesn’t mean advocating for any of these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>All software and copyrighted news/entertainment content accessed via the web should be free.</em> and <em>Netflix, Spotify, HBO Now, etc. should allow anyone to download original music and video files because some people don’t have JavaScript.</em> I’ve never heard anyone say that… ever. Advocating a smart development philosophy doesn’t make you anti-copyright or against making money.</li>
  <li><em>Any content that can’t be accessed via old browsers/devices shouldn’t be on the web in the first place.</em> No one made that judgement. We just think it behooves you to increase the potential reach of your products and to have a workable fallback in case the ideal access scenario isn’t available. You know, smart business decisions.</li>
  <li><em>Everything on the web should have built-in translations into every language.</em> This would be an absurd idea given that the number of languages in use on this planet top 6,500. Even if you consider that 2,000 of those have less than 1,000 speakers it’s still absurd. I don’t know anyone who would advocate for translation to every language.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li><em>Honda needs to consider a universal audience for its marketing websites even though (a) its offline advertising is not universal, and (b) only certain people can access or afford the cars being advertised.</em> To you his first point, Honda does actually offline advertising in multiple languages. They even <a href="http://news.honda.com/newsandviews/article.aspx?id=8340-en">issue press releases mentioning it</a>: “The newspaper and radio advertisements will appear in Spanish or English to match the primary language of each targeted media outlet.” As for his second argument… making assumptions about target audience and who can or cannot afford your product seems pretty friggin’ elitist; it’s also incredibly subjective. For instance, we did a project for a major investment firm where we needed to support Blackberry 4 &amp; 5 even though there were many more popular smartphones on the market. The reason? They had several high-dollar investors who loved their older phones. You can’t make assumptions.</li>
  <li><em>All of the above should also be applied to offline software, books, magazines, newspapers, TV shows, CDs, movies, advertising, etc.</em> Oh, I see, he’s being intentionally ridiculous.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m gonna skip the third fail since it presumes morality is the only argument progressive enhancement has and then chastises the progressive enhancement community for not spending time fighting for equitable Internet access and net neutrality and against things like censorship (which, of course, many of us actually do).</p>

<hr />

<p>In his closing section, Josh talks about progressive enhancement moderates and he quotes <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-future-of-the-web">Matt Griffin on <cite>A List Apart</cite></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing that needs to be considered when we’re experimenting … is who the audience is for that thing. Will everyone be able to use it? Not if it’s, say, a tool confined to a corporate intranet. Do we then need to worry about sub-3G network users? No, probably not. What about if we’re building on the open web but we’re building a product that is expressly for transferring or manipulating HD video files? Do we need to worry about slow networks then? … Context, as usual, is everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, <em>it depends</em>, which is what we’ve all been saying all along.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with these facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Progressive enhancement has many benefits, not the least of which are resilience and reach.</li>
  <li>You don’t have to like or even use progressive enhancement, but that doesn’t detract from its usefulness.</li>
  <li>If you ascribe to progressive enhancement, you may have a project (or several) that aren’t really good candidates for it (e.g., online photo editing software).</li>
  <li>JavaScript is a crucial part of the progressive enhancement toolbox.</li>
  <li>JavaScript availability is never guaranteed, so it’s important to consider offering fallbacks for critical tasks.</li>
  <li>Progressive enhancement is neither moral nor amoral, it’s just a smart way to build for the Web.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is progressive enhancement necessary to use on every project?</p>

<p><em>No.</em></p>

<p>Would users benefit from progressive enhancement if it was followed on more sites than it is now?</p>

<p><em>Heck yeah.</em></p>

<p>Is progressive enhancement right for your project?</p>

<p><em>It depends.</em></p>

<p>Wow. It’s hard to believe it’s been that long. User #12,028 (back when they were still sequential).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>If memory serves, <a href="https://twitter.com/adactio">Jeremy Keith</a> was the first to suggest I join Twitter. Jeremy and I had met for the first time at SXSW in 2005 and became fast friends. That was the same year I met <a href="https://twitter.com/andybudd">Andy Budd</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/clagnut">Richard Rutter</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldman">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb">Eric Meyer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shauninman">Shaun Inman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenseninman">Leslie Jensen</a> (pre-Inman), <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria">Jason Santa Maria</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RobWeychert">Rob Weychert</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sil">Stuart Langridge</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/malarkey">Andrew (née Andy “Malarkey”) Clarke</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hicksdesign">Jon Hicks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/t">Tantek Çelik</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/goodwitch">Glenda Sims</a>, and so many more amazing (and influential) web designers. We became quite the posse and dutifully packed the mezzanine of the Hampton Inn each and every morning before the conference started and generally pal-ed around throughout the week. Then we all returned to our respective locales and prepared to do it all over again the next year.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I think Jeremy was the first to suggest I try out the burgeoning service our friends <a href="https://twitter.com/biz">Biz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ev">Ev</a> had come up with. We all knew Ev from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogger</a> and he &amp; Biz had worked together on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeo">Odeo</a> (a podcasting service that was <em>way</em> before its time) too. Together, under the moniker “Obvious Corp.”, they had just rolled out a new messaging service called “Twttr” (because who needs vowels). It later spun out of Obvious Corp. as “Twitter”.</p>

<p>Twitter filled a very interesting niche for me back in those days, but I didn’t really notice how much until we all returned to SXSW in 2007. When we had regrouped in 2006, we had spent a lot of time catching up on the developments in our lives that had taken place in the intervening year (at least those we hadn’t blogged about). 2007, however, was different.</p>

<p>By the time SXSW rolled around in March of that year, we’d all been actively using Twitter for nearly six months. And because so few people were on Twitter at the time <em>and</em> we all followed each other, it was quite easy to keep up-to-date with what was going on in everyones’ lives. Twitter created this sort of <em>ambient awareness</em> of everything important that was going on with the folks in the group. So when we returned to Austin in March of 2007, we didn’t spend any time catching up on the events of the intervening year because we didn’t need to. We already knew and were able to pick right up as though we hadn’t missed a beat. It was a pretty amazing feeling and played a big part in my falling in love with Twitter.</p>

<p>That love affair continued for years. My relationships with my friends deepened and our collective relationship with Twitter deepened. I don’t think anything illustrates that more than my good friends <a href="https://twitter.com/stefsull">Stephanie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/garazi">Greg</a> getting engaged via the service (yes, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/03/true-story-of-a/">they were the first</a>):</p>

<hr />

<p>In the past decade, Twitter has changed dramatically. Most of us, with the exception of <a href="https://twitter.com/briansuda">Brian</a>, moved away from tweeting in the third person. Here’s my transition (circa 2012… I tweeted for nearly 6 years in the third person!):</p>

<p>Ideas we played with, like <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412">Chris’ suggestion that we add tagging to our tweets</a>, <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/twitter-syntax#Messages">“d” messages</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rsa/status/55281">at-mentions</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericrice/status/31669791">Retweets</a> (later, <a href="https://twitter.com/TDavid/status/641334922">RTs</a>) changed from things we did as a matter of necessity while using the service to integral pieces of “Twitter the Platform”.</p>

<p>In the past decade, the culture of Twitter has also changed. When we were starting out, there was this great feeling of solidarity, togetherness. Twitter was a huge public commons where we were all friendly and respectful, even when we disagreed. In the intervening years (the last few perhaps even moreso), however, Twitter has become this wedge that seems to be driving our society apart. The decisive, bile-and-hatred fueled posts, rampant bigotry, threats of violence, and gross intolerance has become such a downer that each year I pull back a little more. I don’t browse the public stream anymore; I can’t deal with it. I have reduced the number of people I follow and have become more dependent on lists and tools like <a href="http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> and <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">TweetDeck</a> to help me identify the shallows of Twitter I’m interested in wading into. Don’t get me wrong, Twitter still manages to prove its value every now and again. It can absolutely be a force for good, but like so many things that work well in their ideal state, us messy humans have come along and fucked it all up.</p>

<p>In the past decade, Twitter itself has also fundamentally changed. I remember being gobsmacked when I visited the service’s ginormous San Francisco headquarters last year and saw the massive number of people working there. It made me pine for the days when I used to duck out of Adaptive Path’s SoMa office two grab lunch with the 12 (!) people who were running Twitter at the time. Twitter looks all grown up, but to me it still seems like it’s going through a painful adolescence, unsure of what it wants to be. I hope it can find its way, but I’m uncertain if our relationship will survive that.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ten years in, I am still in love with Twitter, but I’m unsure if that love is for the service it has become or if it’s simply a manifestation of my nostalgia. I guess time will tell.</p>

<p><em>Jeremy Keith also recently celebrated his first decade on Twitter. You should definitely read <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/11436">his thoughts &amp; recollections too.</a></em></p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a bit of a geek for proper punctuation: Em dashes… en dashes… curly quotes… ellipses… I love them all! Prior to 2007, I was a long-time Windows user and was a master of the <kbd>Alt + <var>numeric code</var></kbd> system of entering special characters on that operating system.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> For nearly a decade, however, I’ve been writing and developing on a Mac and I absolutely love how much easier it is to use special characters.  When I started setting up my new Surface Book, I began searching for a way to bring Mac-like special character entry to Windows 10.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-set-up-autohotkey">Step 1: Set up AutoHotKey</h2>

<p><a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/01/26/how-to-create-keyboard-shortcuts-for-special-characters-in-windows-10.aspx">David Nagel’s solid article on mapping keystrokes in Windows</a>, I introduced me to <a href="https://autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a>. It’s an incredibly powerful program that’s like the lovechild of <a href="https://textexpander.com/">TextExpander</a> and <a href="https://qsapp.com/">Quicksilver</a>.</p>

<p>In his article, David walks through the process of getting set up with AutoHotKey:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://autohotkey.com/download/">Download</a> &amp; install it.</li>
  <li>Create a new <code>.ahk</code> file (<samp>New &gt; AutoHotKey Script</samp> in Windows Explorer) and name it whatever you like.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Right-click the script, and choose <samp>Edit Script</samp> from the context menu.</li>
  <li>Enter some keyboard shortcuts (more on that in a moment).</li>
  <li>Save the script. I chose to save it to Dropbox to make it portable.</li>
  <li>Double click it to run the script.</li>
  <li>Open up your favorite writing tool and see your handiwork in action.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="step-2-create-some-shortcuts">Step 2: Create some shortcuts</h2>

<p>AutoHotKey is completely scriptable and adding shortcuts is relatively straightforward. There are a few reserved characters, but once you understand what they are it’s pretty easy to get going very quickly. Here’s Dave’s intro example:</p>

        <div class="js-gist-file-update-container js-task-list-container file-box">
  <div id="file-sample-ahk" class="file">
    

  <div itemprop="text" class="blob-wrapper data type-autohotkey">
      <table class="highlight tab-size js-file-line-container" data-tab-size="8">
      <tr>
        <td id="file-sample-ahk-L1" class="blob-num js-line-number" data-line-number="1"></td>
        <td id="file-sample-ahk-LC1" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line"><span class="pl-en">!-</span>::–</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td id="file-sample-ahk-L2" class="blob-num js-line-number" data-line-number="2"></td>
        <td id="file-sample-ahk-LC2" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line"><span class="pl-en">!+-</span>::—</td>
      </tr>
</table>

  </div>

  </div>
  
</div>

      </div>
      <div class="gist-meta">

<p>In AutoHotKey scripting, “!” stands in for <kbd>Alt</kbd> and “+” stands in for <kbd>Shift</kbd>. So, to translate:</p>

<ol>
  <li><kbd>Alt + -</kbd> will produce an en dash (–)</li>
  <li><kbd>Shift Alt + -</kbd> will produce an em dash (—)</li>
</ol>

<p>With these two examples, I was able to jump right in and map many of the most common shortcuts I use while writing. Before I got too far, however, I realized I really needed accents, umlauts, and the like. I searched some more and eventually discovered <a href="https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/27801-special-characters-osx-style">a post in the AutoHotKey forum archive by “Veil” from way back in 2008</a>.</p>

<p>Veil broke his solution into two parts, but I’ve combined them here to make it easier for your to copy into your AutoHotKey script file. This code has provided everything I’ve needed so far, so Veil—wherever you are—<strong>thank you</strong>!</p>

<h2 id="step-3-run-your-script-when-windows-starts">Step 3: Run your script when Windows starts</h2>

<p>The last thing you’ll want to do is add your <code>.ahk</code> file to Windows’ startup items. Dave covered that in his piece as well:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a shortcut to your file (<samp>Right click &gt; Create Shortcut</samp>)</li>
  <li>Run <code>shell:startup</code> (<kbd>⊞ Win + R</kbd> opens the Run dialog or you can type ”Run“ in the Cortana Search Box)</li>
  <li>Move your shortcut to the folder that opens.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you’ve followed those steps, you’re done. You can update your <code>.ahk</code> scripts needed and just double click it to replace the instance that’s currently running.</p>

<hr />

<p>If, like me (and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23davegoeswindows">Dave</a> and <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/other/running-into-windows">Jonathan</a> and <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/opening-windows/">Dan</a>), you’re using Windows after a long time in Mac land <em>and</em> you’re a typography nerd, hopefully you’ll find this helpful. And if you come up with any improvements to the character mapping, please share!</p>

      <p>I actually memorized a ton of <a href="http://tools.oratory.com/altcodes.html">the codes</a>, much to my amazement. I still remember a few, but I am thankful to have reclaimed a bit of that memory space over the last few years. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>If you shun the mouse, you can create a text file in your favorite editor and name it with the <code>.ahk</code> extension, but you might run into character encoding issues. I created mine in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> as UTF-8, but had to open the file in Notepad and re-save it again to get it to actually work. I never figured out the exact issue, but I thought I’d give you a heads-up. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.webbloatscore.com/">Web Bloat Score Calculator</a> has been making the rounds on Twitter and I wanted to share my immediate thoughts on it.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First off, I am a big fan of simple tools that provide an often much-needed reality check on a project. Based squarely on its simplicity, I’d put this tool right up there alongside <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a> and <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">What Does My Site Cost?</a>. The Web Bloat Score (or WebBS… clever) Calculator is about as simple an interface as you can get: Enter a URL &amp; hit the “Calculate” button.</p>

<p>When you do this, the service runs two tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Load the URL and all of its assets, calculating a total page weight and chronicling the number of requests required to get there; and</li>
  <li>Generate a static screen capture of the page and then grab its file size.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once it has these two bits of info, it compares the real file size of the tested page against the image version to come up with your WebBS.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.webbloatscore.com">ran the calculator against the 10k Apart contest homepage</a> and here are the results:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">URL</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Page Size</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Requests</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Image Size</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">WebBS</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">https://a-k-apart.com/</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">200 <abbr title="kilobytes">kB</abbr></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">49</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">195 <abbr title="kilobytes">kB</abbr></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">1.03</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Not too bad, considering <a href="http://www.webbloatscore.com/Details/612ea9a9-c548-4e20-99d1-910b449ba2c4">the number of images on the page</a> and the interactivity of the SVG. In the documentation about the tool, they have this to say about a high WebBS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A high WebBS usually indicates unused stuff on the page: JavaScript, CSS, oversized images, etc. Maybe you have a valid reason for that content. But more often than not, it means you can optimize it more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree with the sentiment here: smaller is better and if there’s a huge discrepancy between the file size of an image of your page and the page itself, there <em>may</em> be something not so awesome going on behind the scenes. They reference Amazon as being particularly bad, with a WebBS of 20 (<a href="http://www.webbloatscore.com/Details/4abea720-677c-48f6-9ff2-2b816424be06">I got 12.3 in my test</a>, but Amazon frequently changes their homepage).</p>

<p>There’s always room for improvement when it comes to optimization, but I also worry about folks getting too hung up on numbers like this, especially striving for a score of 1 or less. Here are a few legitimate reasons your score may be more than 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your page is heavily interactive.</strong> The calculator does not take into account any sort of interactivity—progressively enhanced or not—nor does it tell you how well-optimized your JavaScript code is. There’s also the possibility that you’ve consciously decided to trade verbosity for speed. For large loops, for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff’s device</a> is much faster but a lot more verbose than a normal <code>for</code> loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Your page serves alternate file formats.</strong> The tool runs <a href="http://slimerjs.org/">SlimerJS</a> to collect the performance data and, for instance, it doesn’t currently support WebP images. We serve WebP with a JPG or PNG fallback on the 10k Apart site (using <code>picture</code>), but <a href="http://www.webbloatscore.com/Details/612ea9a9-c548-4e20-99d1-910b449ba2c4">the file log</a> doesn’t include the WebP images at all.</li>
  <li><strong>You make use of micro-optimizations.</strong> Perhaps you use <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS"><code>loadCSS</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadJS"><code>loadJS</code></a> or split your CSS into a default and advanced stylesheet (with the advanced one only loading if media queries are supported). Perhaps you lazy load images or fonts via JavaScript. Perhaps you only load certain assets or scripts based on browser capabilities. The calculator takes none of this into account.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just three reasons to take your WebBS with a grain of salt. It’s good for a gut-check, but I wouldn’t spend a whole lot of time worrying about getting your score at or below 1.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an excellent missive from Nicholas covering the progressive enhancement debate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First … progressive enhancement isn’t about having a JavaScript vs. JavaScript-disabled experience, it’s about providing the best possible user experience throughout the entire lifecycle of the web application. …</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, progressive enhancement isn’t a strict prescription, it’s a way of thinking about the software you’re building. … Instead, it encourages you to think more deeply about the problem you’re trying to solve, and guides you towards solutions that work for the maximum number of users.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>These two points are why I believe progressive enhancement is as relevant today as it has ever been. The only difference now is that we have more options for improving the user experience than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t have said it better myself.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Accessibility is hard. It’s a broad term encompassing a variety of special needs ranging from low vision and color blindness to motor impairment and language barriers (to name but a few) which means guaranteeing our projects are “100% accessible” is a significant challenge.</p>

<p>Accessibility becomes even more of a challenge when you begin to factor in the dependency chain. Blind and low-vision users, for example, often use screen readers in order to access the Web. With screen readers, we need to consider the capabilities of both the browser <em>and</em> the screen reader being used. If either piece of software isn’t up to the task or contains a bug our users suffer for it.</p>

<p>Getting multiple inter-dependent programs on the same page sometimes requires that we do things we’d rather not do. This post from Steve Faulkner chronicles one such case where the particular versions of Chrome and JAWS required for a project didn’t see eye-to-eye on the semantics of heading levels. He talks about the issue and the less-than-optimal fix he had to put in place to ensure users got the experience they were meant to.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love how Mandy deftly wove progressive enhancement into her content strategy and publishing discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps ironically, we’ve found that the best way to create that resiliency is by harking back to the web principle of <em>progressive enhancement</em>: each story created in Chorus begins as a platform-neutral collection of text, images, and video. That foundation ensures that we can publish that story as easily to our own platform as to, say, AMP or Apple News, and be confident that our audience will experience that story in a way that fits whichever platform they are using. On our own platform, we’re then free to enhance up, adding stylistic or experiential flairs that elevate the experience of the story. This practice — which I refer to unoriginally as <em>progressively enhanced storytelling</em> — also has the added benefit of helping us make our content more accessible to more kinds of users, especially those with disabilities. (It wouldn’t be inaccurate to consider speaking browsers one among the many platforms we must publish to.)</p>
