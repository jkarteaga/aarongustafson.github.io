    <p>In case you missed it, <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/10/updating-our-technical-webmaster.html">yesterday Pierre Far updated Google’s Webmaster Guidelines</a>. In his post, Pierre lays out their case for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just like modern browsers, our rendering engine might not support all of the technologies a page uses. Make sure your web design adheres to the principles of progressive enhancement as this helps our systems (and a wider range of browsers) see usable content and basic functionality when certain web design features are not yet supported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone who has been beating the drum for progressive enhancement for over a decade, this sort of support from such an influential company gets me a little teary-eyed.</p>

<p>It’s nice to see Steve Champeon’s philosophy for web design finally beginning to gain traction outside of the ivory tower of Web standards. It is a fantastic philosophy that has been guiding our work since Steve unveiled it. And it has paid some handsome dividends for both us and our clients.</p>

<p>If you need help wrapping your head around progressive enhancement, you should read <a href="#fn-2014-10-28">my introductory series for <cite>A List Apart</cite></a>. If you want more, there’s also <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info">my book on progressive enhancement: <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite></a>. And if you need help getting your team up to speed, I’m more than happy to hop on a plane and come to you. Just <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a>. I have helped many companies embrace this philosophy and have seen it improve their productivity, increase their reach by supporting more devices, and improve the accessibility of their products. Oh… and <a href="http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/the-true-cost-of-progressive-enhancement">progressive enhancement has saved our clients real money and reduced their time to market</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t tend to be a “magic pill” kind of believer, but I can honestly say that embracing progressive enhancement can radically change your business for the better. And I’m glad to see Google agrees with me.</p>
