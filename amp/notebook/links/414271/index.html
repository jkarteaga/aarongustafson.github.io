    <p>I have been grappling with a lot of the concerns this fantastic article raises. In particular, this bit resonated with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would-be “engineers” are encouraged to think of every project as a potential business ready to scale and sell, rather than as a process of long-term training in disciplines where concerns for social welfare become paramount. Engineering has always been a well-paid profession, but computing is turning it into a type of speculative finance rather than a calling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a generalization, but it’s also a trend I’ve been seeing. I’m also on the fence regarding licensure and continuing education credits. I think they could do a lot to improve the state of the Web without destroying the wonderful DIY nature of its accessibility.</p>
