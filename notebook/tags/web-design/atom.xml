    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sixteen years ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/stewart">Stewart Butterfield</a> conceived of a contest that would test the mettle of any web designer: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000510010054/http:/www.sylloge.com/5k/home.html">The 5k</a>. The idea was that entrants would build <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/5k">an entire site in 5kB of code or less</a>. Its aim was to force us to get creative by putting a bounding box on what we could do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between servers and bandwidth, clients and users, HTML and the DOM, browsers and platforms, our conscience and our ego, we’re left in a very small space to find highly optimal solutions. Since the space we have to explore is so small, we have to look harder, get more creative; and that’s what makes it all interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- more -->

<p>The 5k contest ran from 2000 until 2002. In 2010, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2010/07/29/10k-apart-%E2%80%93%C2%A0inspire-the-web/">An Event Apart and Microsoft revived the idea</a> with an updated limit and a new name: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100730090946/http:/10k.aneventapart.com/">10k Apart</a>. Staying true to its roots, this new incarnation, which ran for two years, continued to push designers and developers to get creative within a pretty extreme (though slightly expanded) limit while incorporating new goodies like HTML5 and responsive design.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled to announce that <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/">the 10k Apart contest is back</a> and brings with it a handful of new challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Each page must be usable in 10kB or less.</strong> The 10kB limit no longer applies to the size of a ZIP archive of your entry; the 10kB limit now applies to the total initial download size of the baseline experience of each page in your project. When we say “baseline experience,” we’re talking small screen devices running older, less capable browsers. The 10kB limit will apply to every page and whatever assets it loads by default; that means images, CSS, JavaScript, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Progressive enhancement is the name of the game.</strong> Your project should start with a super-basic, bare-bones-but-usable experience that will work no matter what (including without JavaScript). You can use clever CSS and JavaScript techniques to enhance that experience as it makes sense to do so. For example: You might lazy load an image using JavaScript if the screen size is above a certain threshold or when certain other conditions are met. Entries that depend entirely on JavaScript to render the front-end won’t be accepted. If you need a primer on progressive enhancement, <a href="http://alistapart.com/search?keywords=progressive%20enhancement">consult the pages of <cite>A List Apart</cite></a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Back ends are in this year.</strong> In previous iterations, each entry comprised client-side code submitted via ZIP file. Over time, that limitation led to an over-reliance on JavaScript for rendering. No more. This year, you can create dynamic experiences that work without front-end JavaScript using Node, PHP, Python or .Net. You will submit your entry as public GitHub repository (so we can all learn from your awesome code) and we’ll spin up a dedicated <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Azure</a> instance running the appropriate stack.</li>
  <li><strong>Entries should be accessible.</strong> In line with the philosophy of progressive enhancement, your entry should be usable by the broadest number of users possible. <a href="http://www.accessiq.org/news/commentary/2012/09/web-accessibility-is-a-mindset-not-a-checklist">Accessibility is not a checklist</a>, but if you’re clueless about where to start, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">these techniques</a> can offer some guidance.</li>
  <li><strong>Nothing comes for free.</strong> In previous years, we gave a pass if you wanted to use jQuery or load some fonts from Typekit. This year we decided to change it up, not because we don’t love these products (we do), but because we wanted to force every piece of code, every asset, to fight for its place in your entry. Anything you add should be added with purpose.</li>
</ol>

<p>As with previous editions, your entry should use web standards and work in all modern browsers. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features and APIs that don’t have across-the-board support as long as you do so in keeping with the progressive enhancement philosophy. In other words, your entry can’t depend on that technology or feature in order to be usable.</p>

<p>All of this may sound like a tall order, but it’s entirely possible. In fact, the site we built for the contest also abides by these rules. My colleagues and I will touch on some of the techniques we used (and concessions we made) in building the site in future posts.</p>

<p>If you’ve read this far, you might be wondering <em>What’s in it for me?</em> Well, bragging rights, of course, but we’ve got some awesome prizes too! We’re giving away $10,000 to the top three entries, plus <a href="http://aneventapart.com/events">tickets to An Event Apart</a>, complete collections of <a href="https://abookapart.com/collections/standards-collection">A Book Apart titles</a>, and copies of <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/">my book</a> too. <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/#prizes">Complete details of the prizes</a> are over on <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/">the contest site</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve lined up an amazing group to judge the entires this year too: <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lara_hogan">Lara Hogan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto">Mat Marquis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Heydonworks">Heydon Pickering</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jensimmons">Jen Simmons</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan">Sara Soueidan</a> will all be putting your entry through its paces and peering under the hood at your code. There’s also a People’s Choice award which will be based on votes you cast. Voting will open October 1st and run through October 14th.</p>

<p>The contest opened Monday and we will accept entries until 5pm Pacific Time on September 30th. <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/legal">Everything you should need to know about the contest, eligibility, etc.</a> is up on <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/">the 10k Apart site</a>, but if you have additional questions, <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/hi">you can always reach out</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what you come up with! Happy coding!</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/offline-first-love-the-idea-hate-the-name/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-28T08:25:26-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/offline-first-love-the-idea-hate-the-name</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2014, I had the great pleasure of listening to <a href="https://twitter.com/misprintedtype">Ola Gasidlo</a> of <a href="http://hood.ie/">Hood.ie</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/103221949">discuss the importance of offline</a> at Beyond Tellerrand in Düsseldorf, Germany. Her excellent talk was my introduction to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=offline+first">the “Offline First” movement</a> and, while I can get behind the idea, I’ve had some serious issues with the name. And with the rise of Service Workers as a simple, usable means of making our content available offline, I thought it worth revisiting the idea of “offline first”, if only to address its core fallacy.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First, the good stuff: The “offline first” movement clearly recognizes the current dilemma of our time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We live in a disconnected &amp; battery powered world, but our technology and best practices are a leftover from the always connected &amp; steadily powered past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/offline.html">App Cache</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/">Web SQL</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/">Web Storage</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/">Indexed DB</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/">Service Workers</a>, and a handful of other specs and ideas were all created to address this core limitation of the Web. They also make it possible to compete with “native” software experiences. I am 100% on board with this move. It sucks to open Chrome on my mobile and switch to a tab that’s been tucked out of view for a while only to have the page fail to load because I happen to be traveling abroad without a data plan. If that site was made to work offline, the fact that Chrome had recycled the RAM and CPU that tab had been consuming would be less of a problem and the page would load instantly from the cache.</p>

<p>Tunnels… hotel wifi… high latency mobile networks… expensive roaming data plans… these are all reasons we need an offline Web. I’m incredibly thankful for all of the hard work the smart folks working on solutions like these are contributing.</p>

<p>Also inline with the “offline first” movement, I think it’s important to consider the offline experience early in a project, so it isn’t forgotten or haphazardly bolted on. We need to make deliberate choices about what content and assets we are caching. We need to plan for offline, maybe not <em>first</em>, but certainly early.</p>

<p>All of this is to say I don’t have an issue with the philosophy of “offline first”, but I do take issue with the name. As a term, it’s a bit disingenuous. Looking at other “firsts”—”mobile first” or (to go back little further) “content first”—these terms work on multiple levels: They remind us to keep the core purpose of a page or interface central to our planning. They also support an experience that begins and ends with that core.</p>

<p>A “mobile first” experience starts with a distraction-free central message or content, optimized for a small screen and (often) a single, narrow viewport. It can be enhanced for larger screens and more capable devices, but that core experience may be all some users get, and that’s ok. Users will have an experience (and a site that works) no matter what. The same is true with a “content first” approach; its experience remains available regardless of device or access mechanism. Sure, both “mobile first” and “content first” require the network, but guess what: “<strong>Offline first” requires network connectivity too!</strong> <a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/forums/showthread.php?62807-Run-Website-from-a-Flashdrive-or-CD">You don’t see many websites delivering their content on USB drives</a>, so all of the code required to make the offline experience possible in the first place requires an initial (and stable) connection to the Web. In other words, offline can’t be first.</p>

<p>You may be wondering <em>Why is that important?</em> It’s important because, historically, a “first” approach (as I mentioned) sets an expectation of that experience always being available. Offline can’t provide that.</p>

<p>Moreover, offline has another core dependency beyond the network: JavaScript. Without JavaScript, none of your fancy offline stuff—except App Cache, which few folks are using these days—will work. And yes, I know, <em>everyone</em> has JavaScript support… but the reality is that <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">not everyone will get your JavaScript enhancements</a>, <a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html">even if that were actually the case</a>.</p>

<p>Please don’t misunderstand the purpose of this post: I applaud the ideas behind the “offline first” movement and the amazing work that community is doing. And you should absolutely incorporate offline into projects you are building for the Web. Users with capable devices and browsers will thank you for it. Just try not to use the term “offline first” or at least be prepared for me to cringe a little when you do. Maybe I’m the only one who feels this way; if so, I’m okay with that. But, then again, semantics matter. Maybe we need a different rallying cry. Sadly “Offline Too” doesn’t have the same ring to it.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/an-event-apart-nashville-2016-day-one/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-16T10:54:59-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/an-event-apart-nashville-2016-day-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to spend Tuesday in Nashville for An Event Apart (for reasons that will be revealed in about a month), but I did catch Monday and it was amazing.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The esteemed <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> kicked the day off with a talk entitled <em>Designing with Web Standards in 2016</em>. A theme he touched on repeatedly was that none of the problems we are facing in web design today are new problems. It’s a topic near and dear to my heart, something I wrote about in the closing chapter of <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/"><cite>Adaptive Web Design’s</cite> Second Edition</a> and <a href="/notebook/learn-from-the-past-enhance-for-the-future/">recently spoke about at EnhanceConf in London</a>. He knocked this one out of the park and my head was nodding so much my neck began to hurt.</p>

<p>Next up was <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/">my former WaSP colleague</a> <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel Andrew</a> to give us the skinny on CSS Grid Layouts. This is an amazing spec that I’ve always struggled to understand fully (despite the fact that’s i’ve written a Javascript polyfill for it). Rachel made it crystal clear and got me very excited about the future of layout on the Web.</p>

<p><a href="http://jensimmons.com/">Jen Simmons</a> dropped some serious CSS-related design knowledge bombs that perfectly complimented Rachel’s talk. She discussed Flexbox, CSS Shapes, Multi-column layout, viewport units and more, demonstrating how they can be used right now to progressively enhance the design of your sites.</p>

<p>After lunch, <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a> took to the stage to talk about Style Guides. I only caught the last half—I’ll admit to doing some last-minute rehearsing in the hallway—but the bits I did catch were good. I’ve seen his Atomic Design talk a few times, which this one builds on. In this talk he touches on a lot of the atomic design concepts, but he also talked a lot more about workflow and the role of the front-end developer. No doubt the evolution of this talk has come in large part through writing <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/">a book on Atomic Design</a> and in hosting <a href="http://styleguides.io/podcast/">a podcast with Anna Debenham on website style guides</a>.</p>

<p>Next, I was given the opportunity to share some thoughts and advice on designing and building. My talk, <em>The Features of Highly Effective Forms</em>, evolved out of several earlier talks on building forms. With this one, I wanted to strike a little more balance between the nuts and bolts of building forms and the hows and whys of building better forms.</p>

<p>The deck, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/the-features-of-highly-effective-forms-an-event-apart-nashville-2016">which I’ve posted to SlideShare</a>, doesn’t stand on its own quite as well as some of my other forms decks simply because the talk contained a lot of storytelling I chose not to pair with slides—instead opting for an black screen so folks could focus—but I did call out the salient points. I’ve begun writing up some of the recommendations as part of my <a href="/notebook/tags/web-forms/">Modern Web Forms Best Practices series</a> and will continue to do so in the future. And one of the stories I told, which I highly recommend you check out, had to do with <a href="/notebook/consider-how-your-forms-read/">a lesson Facebook learned in managing how users report offensive photos</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Josh Clark</a> wrapped the day up with a discussion of the future of interface as things move from digital back to physical. He talked about a lot of really cool new tech that has me excited about the future, including <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">the Physical Web</a>, which Josh had running as a live demo. I wonder if anyone noticed I had a beacon running too ;-)</p>

<p>All in all, day one was a blast. As always, Jeffrey, Eric, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/toby-malina-6247a028">Toby</a>, and <a href="http://www.escapadeproductions.com/">Marci</a> do an awesome job programming their events. I’m really bummed I could not stick around to see <a href="http://valhead.com/">Val</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/grigs">Jason</a>, <a href="http://www.kryshiggins.com/">Krystal</a>, <a href="http://meyerweb.com/">Eric</a>, <a href="http://braintraffic.com/">Kristina</a>, and <a href="http://cameronmoll.com/">Cameron</a> rock it out though. I’m sure it was amazing.</p>

<p>You can check out attendees thoughts from the event by <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23aeansh&amp;src=typd">searching Twitter using the #aeansh hashtag</a>. I’ve <a href="https://storify.com/AaronGustafson/reactions-and-takeaways-from-my-aeansh-talk">collected reactions to my talk on Storify</a> for posterity as well.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/affirming-user-choice-with-checkboxes/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-06T14:24:31-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/affirming-user-choice-with-checkboxes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“Checkbox” form controls have long been a part of software. They enable users to provide a simple binary response—yes or no. On the Web, we often see them in two scenarios: confirmations and multiple choice.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="confirmation-checkboxes">Confirmation Checkboxes</h2>

<p>Standalone checkboxes are often employed to enable users to affirm a statement, as in <a href="#fig-2016-01-06-01">this example</a> from <a href="https://online.americanexpress.com/myca/logon/us/action/LogonHandler?request_type=LogonHandler&amp;Face=en_US#lilo_loginForm">the American Express login form</a> where a customer can indicate they’d like the site to remember them.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-01" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/01.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/01.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>American Express’ login form offers users the option of being remembered. As that is a binary choice (e.g. yes or no), the checkbox makes sense.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Here’s a simplification of the markup they’re using:</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/d281f889a11634b45280.js?file=american-express-login-simplified.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot; name=&quot;REMEMBERME&quot;&gt;
&lt;label for=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot;&gt;Remember Me&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This works really well, though I generally prefer to <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/labeled-with-love/#an-alternate-approach">combine explicit and implicit labeling</a> to simplify my CSS selectors and broaden their applicability. Here’s how I would rewrite this control:</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/d281f889a11634b45280.js?file=american-express-login-reimagined.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;label for=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot; name=&quot;REMEMBERME&quot;&gt;
  Remember Me
&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Regardless of the markup pattern itself, it’s important to note the explicit association of the form control and the <code>label</code> element (using the <code>for</code> attribute). You’ll also notice the input has a straightforward <code>name</code> value which will be submitted to the back end if the user ticks the box.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that some back-end systems may require a value be submitted for the given variable name (in this case, “REMEMBERME”) regardless of whether the user has ticked the checkbox. If that’s a requirement, you can alter the pattern to use a hidden <code>input</code> as well:</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/d281f889a11634b45280.js?file=american-express-login-with-hidden.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;REMEMBERME&quot; value=&quot;no&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot; name=&quot;REMEMBERME&quot; value=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
&lt;label for=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot;&gt;Remember Me&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>The source order matters because with matching <code>name</code> values, the final submittable <code>value</code> will always be the one the back-end receives. With this setup, the <code>value</code> of “no” (from the hidden <code>input</code>) will be submitted by default. If the checkbox is ticked, its <code>value</code> is submitted instead, setting REMEMBERME to “yes”.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-choice-checkboxes">Multiple Choice Checkboxes</h2>

<p>The other way we often see checkboxes used is to enable users to choose zero or more items from a collection of options. Consider <a href="#fig-2016-01-06-02">this example</a> from <a href="http://chadevicelab.org/book-time">the Chattanooga Open Device Lab’s reservation form</a>. It allows users to choose the devices they’d like to include in their test matrix:</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-02" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/02.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/02.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>In this excerpt from the reservation form on the Chattanooga Open Device Lab website, users can choose to include gaming system options.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The markup they employ is pretty well-organized and straightforward: it’s a list of checkbox options.</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/d281f889a11634b45280.js?file=chaodl-checkbox-list.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;nintendo-ds-lite&quot;&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;
             name=&quot;reservation_requested_device[]&quot;
             id=&quot;nintendo-ds-lite&quot;
             value=&quot;Nintendo DS Lite (Upper Cabinet #13)&quot;
             data-checkbox-required=&quot;&quot;
             &gt;
      Nintendo DS Lite
    &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;nintendo-wii&quot;&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;
             name=&quot;reservation_requested_device[]&quot;
             id=&quot;nintendo-wii&quot;
             value=&quot;Nintendo Wii (TV Area)&quot;
             data-checkbox-required=&quot;&quot;
             &gt;
      Nintendo Wii
    &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;!-- list continues --&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>As this is an instance where a user could choose more than one option, the back end needs to be able to capture that information in what’s called an “array”. An array, if you’re unfamiliar, is a collection of values. You’ll notice that the <code>name</code> given to each of these checkbox <code>input</code> elements is the same: “reservation_requested_device[]”. The square brackets (“[]”) at the end of the <code>name</code> are the magic bit that allows the values of <em>each</em> chosen “reservation_requested_device” checkbox to be submitted as the value of “reservation_requested_device”.</p>

<h2 id="applicable-attributes">Applicable Attributes</h2>

<p>Checkbox controls only use a subset of the typical <code>input</code> attributes. In particular, you’ll need to include</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>name</code> - This is the variable name you want to hold the user’s response. As mentioned in <a href="#multiple-choice-checkboxes">the previous section</a>, appending “[]” to the variable name will allow the variable to hold all of the user’s choices as opposed to only the final one.</li>
  <li><code>value</code> - This is the value that should be captured if the user ticks the checkbox.</li>
  <li><code>id</code> - The unique identifier you’re using for the control in order to explicitly associate it with a <code>label</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few optional attributes you might consider including as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>checked</code> - Use this null attribute if you want the default state of the checkbox to be ticked. This attribute should be used with caution. <strong>Don’t</strong> use this attribute to automatically check confirmation boxes for things like mailing list opt-ins. <strong>Do</strong> use this attribute when you are displaying sensible default settings or displaying confirmations the user has already made (e.g. in the user’s profile or when re-displaying the form when it has a submission error).</li>
  <li><code>required</code> - Use this to indicate the checkbox must be ticked for the form to be valid. It’s important to note that this attribute is typically only useful in confirmation checkbox scenarios. If you need a user to choose at least one from a multiple choice checkbox collection, it’s useless unless you need them to pick a specific one. To require one (or more) of a multiple choice checkbox group, you currently need to use JavaScript, like <a href="https://github.com/easy-designs/easy-checkbox-required.js">the one the Chattanooga Open Device Lab uses</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="checkbox-vs-other-controls">Checkbox vs. Other Controls</h2>

<p>Checkboxes excel at allowing users to indicate preference from a pre-defined set of options. But there are other form control types that allow for similar control over user responses. That can make it difficult to decide which element to use.</p>

<h3 id="dropdown-list-select">Dropdown List (<code>select</code>)</h3>

<p>The <code>select</code> element is another tried and true option for allowing users to indicate preference. A simple two-choice <code>select</code> could achieve the same goal as a confirmation checkbox, but it’s a little clunkier. In terms of user interface, <code>select</code> elements require more clicks of your users. They also obscure the complete list of choices from view because only one options is displayed at a time. Their appearance makes them more compact, but can make it difficult to get a complete picture of what choices are available when you can’t see them all.</p>

<p>You can enable multiple choice in a  <code>select</code> element by adding the <code>multiple</code> attribute to it, but depending on the number of <code>option</code> elements, it could also be a little unwieldy. Depending on the size of the <code>select</code> and the number of options, you could also create an inner scroll that could be awkward on certain touch-based devices.</p>

<p>The <code>select</code> element has its place, but should be used sparingly. I’ll go in-depth with <code>select</code> elements in a future post.</p>

<h3 id="choose-one-inputtyperadio">Choose One (<code>input[type=radio]</code>)</h3>

<p>For simple confirmation questions, it’s completely valid to use a radio form control in lieu of a single checkbox. In fact, in some cases, it may offer a more explicit choice for your users. Consider <a href="#fig-2016-01-06-03">this example</a> from <a href="https://order.subway.com">Subway’s online ordering tool</a>.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-03" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/03.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/03.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/03.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/03.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>In this excerpt from Subway’s online ordering tool, they use a checkbox to confirm the user wants their sandwich toasted.</figcaption></figure>

<p>A checkbox labelled “Fresh Toasted”, isn’t terribly clear. A better approach would be to ask something like “Would you like your sandwich toasted?” with radio controls for “yes” and “no”. Alternately, if they absolutely wanted to keep it as a checkbox, they could use a better label: “Please toast my sandwich”.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-04" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/04.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/04.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/04.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/04.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>An alternate approach to the Subway interface, using radio controls.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Radio controls have their place, but are not often a one-to-one replacement for checkboxes. I will discuss radio controls in greater depth in another post.</p>

<h2 id="check-em-out">Check ’Em Out</h2>

<p>Checkboxes are an invaluable tool in the form building tool chest. Understanding their purpose and capabilities is key to using them properly and ensuring your forms are usable to the broadest number of users.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>User experience encompasses more than just the interface. Download speed, render performance, and the cost of accessing a site are often overlooked areas when it comes to the practice of UX, but they all affect how users experience what we build on the Web.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’m always looking for ways to improve these aspects of my own site. And, since it’s my own personal playground, I often use it as a test-bed for new technologies, ideas, and techniques. My latest adventure was inspired by a bunch of <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/">articles and posts I’ve linked to recently</a>, especially</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9775">Jeremy Keith’s “My First Service Worker”</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/serviceworker-for-offline/">Nicolas Bevacqua’s “Making a Simple Site Work Offline with ServiceWorker”</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/service-workers--dynamic-responsive-images-using-webp-images/10132/">Dean Hume’s “Service Workers: Dynamic Responsive Images Using Webp Images”</a>, and</li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@cramforce/not-so-micro-optimizations-f867c47b832d#.satdv0fap">Malte Ubl’s “Not so micro optimizations”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After reading these pieces, I decided to see how much I could do to improve the performance of this site, especially on posts with a lot of images and embedded code samples, like <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/labeled-with-love/">my recent post on form labels</a>.</p>

<h2 id="using-resource-hints">Using Resource Hints</h2>

<p>To kick things off, I followed Malte’s advice and used <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/">Resource Hints</a> to <em>prime the pump</em> for any third-party servers hosting assets I use frequently (e.g. Disqus, Twitter, etc.). I used the code Malte references in <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml">the AMP Project</a> as my starting point and <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/main/resource-hints.js">added two new methods (<code>preconnect()</code> and <code>prefetch()</code>) to my global <code>AG</code> object</a>. With that library code in place, I can call those methods as necessary from within my other JavaScript files. Here’s a simplified extract from <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/post/disqus.js">my Disqus integration script</a>:</p>

<h2 id="integrating-service-worker">Integrating Service Worker</h2>

<p>With that in the bag, I set about making my first <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/">Service Worker</a>. I started off gently, using Dean’s piece as a guide. I added a WebP conversion bit to <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/tasks/gulp/images.js">my image processing Gulp task</a> to get the files in place and then I created the Service Worker. By default, <a href="https://gist.github.com/deanhume/c04478df744ce833925c#file-client-hints-service-worker-js">Dean’s code</a> converts <em>all</em> JPG and PNG requests to WebP responses, so I set it up to limit the requests to only those files being requested directly from my server. I have no way of knowing if WebP equivalents of every JPG and PNG exist on the open web (probably not), but I know they exist on my server. Here’s the updated code:</p>

<p>When I began tucking to the caching possibilities of Service Workers, following Nicolas’ and Jeremy’s posts, I <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/serviceworker/fetch-cached.js">opted to tweak Nicholas’ caching setup a bit</a>. I’m still not completely thrilled with it, but it’s a work in progress. I’m sure I will tweak as I get more familiar with the technology.</p>

<p>To keep my Service Worker code modularized (like my other JavaScript code), I opted to <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/tree/source/source/_javascript/serviceworker">break it up into separate files</a> and am using Gulp to merge them all together and move the combined file into the root of the site. If you’d like to follow a similar path, feel free to adapt this Gulp task (which builds all of my JavaScript):</p>

<p>As most of the walkthroughs recommended that you version your Service Worker if you’re doing any caching, I set mine up to be auto-versioned by inserting a timestamp (lines 23-27, above) into my Service Worker header file (line 3, below):</p>

<p>Service Workers are still pretty new (and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers">modestly supported</a>), but it’s definitely interesting to see what’s possible using them. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9844">Like Jeremy</a>, I want to do a bit more exploration into caching and how it may actually <em>increase</em> the monetary cost of accessing a website if not used properly. Like any powerful tool, we need to wield it wisely.</p>

<h2 id="making-gists-static">Making Gists Static</h2>

<p>On particularly code-heavy posts (yes, like this one), I make liberal use of Gists. They’re quite useful, but <a href="https://gist.github.com/BinaryMuse/803483">the Gist plugin for Jekyll</a>, while good, still requests a script from Github in order to load the pretty printed version of the Gist. On some posts, that can mean 5 or more additional network requests, not to mention execution time for the JavaScript. It’s yet another dependency that could prohibit you from quickly getting to the content you’re looking for. Additionally, <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">if JavaScript should be available, but isn’t</a>, you get nothing (since the <code>noscript</code> content is only evaluated if JavaScript support isn’t available or if a user turns it off).</p>

<p>With all of this in mind, I decided to revise the plugin and make it capable of downloading the JavaScript code directly. It then extracts the HTML markup that the JavaScript would be writing into the page and just embeds it directly. It also caches the result, which is handy for speeding up the build process.</p>

<p>You can grab <a href="https://gist.github.com/aarongustafson/b98add8f3580f6707cf5">my fork of the Gist Jekyll Plugin as, well, a Gist</a>. It’s also <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/plugins/gist_tag.rb">in the source of this site on Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hopefully-a-little-faster">(Hopefully) A Little Faster</h2>

<p>All told, these changes have gotten the render time of this site down significantly across the board.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Even more so on browsers that support Service Workers and Resource Hints. I’ll likely continue tweaking as I go, but I wanted to share my process, code, and thoughts in case any of it might be useful to you in your own work. In the end, it’s all about creating better experiences for our users. How our sites perform is a big part of that.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

      <p>Sadly I forgot to run some speed tests prior to rolling out this change and I didn’t feel like rolling back the site, so I don’t have solid numbers for you. That said, it seemed to shave nearly 2 seconds off of the load time on heavy pages like the post I mentioned. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Again, I don’t have the numbers, but I am routinely seeing <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> reached between 400-600ms with Service Worker caching in play. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
