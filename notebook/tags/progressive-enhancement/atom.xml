    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Late last week, Josh Korr, a project manager at Viget, posted at length about <a href="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">what he sees as a fundamental flaw with the argument for progressive enhancement</a>. In reading the post, it became clear to me that Josh really doesn’t have a good grasp on progressive enhancement or the reasons its proponents think it’s a good philosophy to follow. Despite claiming to be “an expert at spotting fuzzy rhetoric and teasing out what’s really being said”, Josh makes a lot of false assumptions and inferences. My response would not have fit in a comment, so here it is…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Before I dive in, it’s worth noting that Josh admits that he is not a developer. As such, he can’t really speak to the bits where the rubber really meets the road with respect to progressive enhancement. Instead, he focuses on the argument for it, which he sees as a purely moral one… and a flimsily moral one at that.</p>

<p>I’m also unsure as to how Josh would characterize me. I don’t think I fit his mold of PE “hard-liners”, but since I’ve written two books and countless articles on the subject and he quotes me in the piece, I’ll go out on a limb and say he probably thinks I am.</p>

<p>Ok, enough with the preliminaries, let’s jump over to his piece…</p>

<hr />

<p>Right out of the gate, Josh demonstrates a fundamental misread of progressive enhancement. If I had to guess, it probably stems from his source material, but he sees progressive enhancement as a moral argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a moral imperative that everything on the web should be available to everyone everywhere all the time. Failing to achieve — or at least strive for — that goal is inhumane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now he’s quick to admit that no one has ever explicitly said this, but this is his takeaway from the articles and posts he’s read. It’s a pretty harsh, black &amp; white, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You're_either_with_us,_or_against_us"><em>you’re either with us or against us</em></a> sort of statement that has so many people picking sides and lobbing rocks and other heavy objects at anyone who disagrees with them. And everyone he quotes in the piece as examples of why he thinks this is progressive enhancement’s central conceit is much more of an “it depends” sort of person.</p>

<p>To clarify, progressive enhancement is neither moral or amoral. It’s a philosophy that recognizes the nature of the Web as a medium and asks us to think about how to build products that are robust and capable of reaching as many potential customers as possible. It isn’t concerned with any particular technology, it simply asks that we look at each tool we use with a critical eye and consider both its benefits and drawbacks. And it’s certainly not anti-JavaScript.</p>

<p>I could go on, but let’s circle back to Josh’s piece. Off the bat he makes some pretty bold claims about what he intends to prove in this piece:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<ol><li>Progressive enhancement is a philosophical, moral argument disguised as a practical approach to web development.</li><li>This makes it impossible to engage with at a practical level.</li><li>When exposed to scrutiny, that moral argument falls apart.</li><li>Therefore, if PEers can’t find a different argument, it’s ok for everyone else to get on with their lives.</li></ol>
</blockquote>

<p>For the record, I plan to address <em>his</em> arguments quite practically. As I mentioned, progressive enhancement is not solely founded on morality, though that can certainly be viewed as a facet. The reality is that progressive enhancement is quite pragmatic, addressing the Web as it exists not as we might hope that it exists or how <em>we</em> experience it.</p>

<p>Over the course of a few sections—which I wish I could link to directly, but alas, the headings don’t have unique <code>id</code>s—he examines a handful of quotes and attempts to tease out their hidden meaning by following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_School_Admission_Test">LSAT</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning">Logic Reasoning</a> framework. We’ll start with the first one.</p>

<h2 id="working-without-javascript">Working without JavaScript</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<h4>Statement</h4>
<ul><li>“When we write JavaScript, it’s critical that we recognize that we can’t be guaranteed it will run.” — <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/missed-connections/">Aaron Gustafson</a></li><li>“If you make your core tasks dependent on JavaScript, some of your potential users will inevitably be left out in the cold.” —&nbsp;<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/7706">Jeremy Keith</a></li></ul>
<p>Unstated assumptions:</p>
<ul><li><em>Because there is some chance JavaScript won’t run, we must always account for that chance.</em></li><li><em>Core tasks can always be achieved without JavaScript.</em></li><li><em>It is always bad to ignore some potential users for any reason.</em></li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>His first attempt at teasing out the meaning of these statements comes close, but ignores some critical word choices. First off, neither Jeremy nor I speak in absolutes. As I mentioned before, we (and the other folks he quotes) all believe that the right technical choices for a project depend on specifically on the purpose and goals of <em>that specific project</em>. In other words <em>it depends</em>. We intentionally avoid absolutist words like “always” (which, incidentally, Josh has no problem throwing around, on his own or on our behalf).</p>

<p>For the development of <em>most</em> websites, the benefits of following a progressive enhancement philosophy far outweigh the cost of doing so. I’m hoping Josh will take a few minutes to read my post on <a href="http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/the-true-cost-of-progressive-enhancement/">the true cost of progressive enhancement in relation to actual client projects</a>. As a project manager, I hope he’d find it enlightening and useful.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that he’s not considering the reason we make statements like this: Many sites rely 100% on JavaScript without needing to. The reasons why sites (like news sites, for instance) are built to be completely reliant on a fragile technology is somewhat irrelevant. But what isn’t irrelevant is that it happens. Often. That’s why I said “it’s critical that we <em>recognize</em> that we can’t be guaranteed it will run” (emphasis mine). A lack of acknowledgement of JavaScript’s fragility is one of the main problems I see with web development today. I suspect Jeremy and everyone else quoted in the post feels exactly the same. To be successful in a medium, you need to understand the medium. And the (sad, troubling, interesting) reality of the Web is that <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/a-fundamental-disconnect/">we don’t control a whole lot</a>. We certainly control a whole lot less than we often believe we do.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I disagree with his characterization of the argument for progressive enhancement being a moral one. Morality can certainly be one argument for progressive enhancement, and as <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/egalitarianism/">a proponent of egalitarianism</a> I certainly see that. But it’s not the only one. If you’re in business, there are a few really good business-y reasons to embrace progressive enhancement:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Progressive enhancement and accessibility are very closely tied. Whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_the_Blind_v._Target_Corp.">brought by legitimate groups</a> or <a href="http://chrishofstader.com/stop-the-ada-trolls/">opportunists</a>, lawsuits over the accessibility of your web presence can happen; following progressive enhancement <em>may</em> help you avoid them.</li>
  <li><strong>Development Costs:</strong> As I mentioned earlier, progressive enhancement is a more cost-effective approach, especially for long-lived projects. Here’s that link again: <a href="http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/the-true-cost-of-progressive-enhancement/">The True Cost of Progressive Enhancement</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Reach:</strong> The more means by which you enable users to access your products, information, etc., the more opportunities you create to earn their business. Consider that no one thought folks would buy big-ticket items on mobile just a few short years ago. Boy, were they wrong. Folks buy cars, planes, and more from their tablets and smartphones on the regular these days.</li>
  <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> When your site is down, not only do you lose potential customers, you run the risk of losing existing ones too. There have been <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/02/07/gawker-outage-causing-twitter-stir">numerous</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/28/sky-broadband-blocks-jquery-web-critical-plugin">incidents</a> where big sites got hosed due to JavaScript dependencies and they didn’t have a fallback. Progressive enhancement ensures users can always do what they came to your site to do, even if it’s not the ideal experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hmm, no moral arguments for progressive enhancement there… but let’s continue.</p>

<h2 id="some-experience-vs-no-experience">Some experience vs. no experience</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<h4>Statement</h4>
<ul><li>“[With a PE approach,] Older browsers get a clunky experience with full page refreshes, but that’s still much, much better than giving them nothing at all.” — <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/7706">Jeremy Keith</a></li><li>“If for some reason JavaScript breaks, the site should still work and look good. If the CSS doesn’t load correctly, the HTML content should still be there with meaningful hyperlinks.” — <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/progressive-enhancement-past-present-future">Nick Pettit</a></li></ul>
<p>Unstated assumptions:</p>
<ul><li><em>A clunky experience is always better than no experience.</em></li><li><em>HTML content — i.e. text, images, unstyled forms — is the most important part of most websites.</em></li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You may be surprised to hear that I have no issue with Josh’s distillation here. Clunky is a bit of a loaded word, but I agree that <em>an</em> experience <em>is</em> better than no experience, especially for critical tasks like checking your bank account, registering to vote, making a purchase from an online shop. In my book, I talk a little bit about a strange thing we experienced <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/netscape">when <cite>A List Apart</cite> stopped delivering CSS to Netscape Navigator 4</a> way back in 2001:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We assume that those who choose to keep using 4.0 browsers have reasons for doing so; we also assume that most of those folks don’t really care about “design issues.” They just want information, and with this approach they can still get the information they seek. In fact, since we began hiding the design from non–compliant browsers in February 2001, ALA’s Netscape 4 readership has increased, from about 6% to about 11%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Folks come to our web offerings for a reason. Sometimes its to gather information, sometimes it’s to be entertained, sometimes it’s to make a purchase. It’s in our best interest to remove every potential obstacle that can preclude them from doing that. That’s good customer service.</p>

<h2 id="project-priorities">Project priorities</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<h4>Statement</h4>
<ul><li>“Question any approach to the web where fancy features for a few are prioritized &amp; basic access is something you’ll ‘get to’&nbsp;eventually.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/tkadlec/status/565951127225896961">Tim Kadlec</a></li></ul>
<p>Unstated assumptions:</p>
<ul><li><em>Everything beyond HTML content is superfluous fanciness.</em></li><li><em>It’s morally problematic if some users cannot access features built with JavaScript.</em></li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to put words in Tim’s mouth (like Josh is here), but what Tim’s quote is discussing is <a href="https://blog.daftcode.pl/hype-driven-development-3469fc2e9b22#.ly6bqxv9s">hype-driven</a> (as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design">user-centered</a>) design. We (as developers) often <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/who-should-pay/">prioritize our own convenience/excitement/interest over our users’ actual needs</a>. It doesn’t happen all the time (note I said <em>often</em>), but it happens frequently enough to require us to call it out now and again (as Tim did here).</p>

<p>As for the “unstated assumptions”, I know for a fact that Tim would never call “everything beyond HTML” superfluous. What he is saying is that we should <em>question</em>—as in weigh the pros and cons—of each and every design pattern and development practice we consider. It’s important to do this because there are always tradeoffs. Some considerations that should be on your list include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download speed;</li>
  <li>Time to interactivity;</li>
  <li>Interaction performance;</li>
  <li>Perceived performance;</li>
  <li>Input methods;</li>
  <li>User experience;</li>
  <li>Screen size &amp; orientation;</li>
  <li>Visual hierarchy;</li>
  <li>Aesthetic design;</li>
  <li>Contrast;</li>
  <li>Readability;</li>
  <li>Text equivalents of rich interfaces for visually impaired users <em>and</em> headless UIs;</li>
  <li>Fallbacks; and</li>
  <li>Copywriting.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is by no means exhaustive nor is it in any particular order; it’s what came immediately to mind for me. Some interfaces may have fewer or more considerations as each is different. And some of these considerations might be in opposition to others depending on the interface. It’s critical that we consider the implications of our design decisions by weighing them against one another before we make any sort of decision about how to progress. Otherwise we open ourselves up to potential problems and the cost of changing things goes up the further into a project we are:</p>

</figure>

<p>As a project manager, I’m sure Josh understands this reality.</p>

<p>As to the “morally problematic” bit, I’ll refer back to <a href="#working-without-javascript">my earlier discussion of business considerations</a>. Sure, morality can certainly be part of it, but I’d argue that it’s unwise to make assumptions about your users regardless. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that all of or users are like us (or like the personas we come up with). My employer, Microsoft, makes a great case for why we should avoid doing this in their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/inclusive">Inclusive Design materials</a>:</p>

<p>If you’re in business, it doesn’t pay to exclude potential customers (or alienate current ones).</p>

<h2 id="erecting-unnecessary-barriers">Erecting unnecessary barriers</h2>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think anyone quoted here would argue that the Web (taken in its entirety) is “the sum of all human knowledge”—Nick, I imagine, was using that phrase somewhat hyperbolically. But there is a lot of information on the Web folks should have access too, whether from a business standpoint or a legal one. What Nick, Jeremy, and Brad are really highlighting here is that we often make somewhat arbitrary design &amp; development decisions that can block access to useful or necessary information and interactions.</p>

<p>In my talk <a href="https://vimeo.com/70018634"><em>Designing with Empathy</em></a> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/designing-with-empathy-beyond-tellerrand-2013">slides</a>), I discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_meat_navigation">“mystery meat” navigation</a>. I can’t imagine any designer sets out to make their site difficult to navigate, but we are influenced by what we see (and are inspired by) on the web. Some folks took inspiration from web-based art projects like this Toyota microsite:</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-12-05-02" class="media-container">

<figcaption>[On Toyota’s Mind](http://www.northkingdom.com/cases/i-huvudet-pa-toyota/) is a classic example of mystery meat navigation. It’s a Flash site and you can navigate when you happen to mouse over "hotspots" in the design. I’m pointing to one with a big red arrow here.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Though probably not directly influenced by On Toyota’s Mind, <a href="https://www.flatbush.org/">Yeshiva of Flatbush</a> was certainly influenced by the concept of “experiential” (which is a polite way of saying “mystery meat”) navigation.</p>

<p>That’s a design/UX example, but development is no different. How many Single Page Apps have you see out there that really didn’t need to be built that way? Dozens? We often put the cart before the horse and decide to build a site using a particular stack or framework without even considering the type of content we’re dealing with or whether that decision is in the best interest of the project or its end users. That goes directly back to <a href="#project-priorities">Tim’s earlier point</a>.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement recognizes that <a href="https://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/read/chapter-1.html#figure-1-2"><strong>experience is a continuum</strong></a> and we all have different needs when accessing the Web. Some are permanent: Low vision or blindness. Some are temporary: Imprecise mousing due to injury. Others are purely situational: Glare when your users are outside on a mobile device or have turned their screen brightness down to conserve battery. When we make our design and development decisions in the service of the project and the users who will access it, everyone wins.</p>

<h2 id="real-answers-to-real-questions">Real answers to real questions</h2>

<p>In the next section, Josh tries to say we only discuss progressive enhancement as a moral imperative. Clearly I don’t (and would go further to say no one else who was quoted does either). He argues that ours is “a philosophical argument, not a practical approach to web development”. I call bullshit. As I’ve just discussed in the previous sections, progressive enhancement is a practical, fiscally-responsible, developmentally robust philosophical approach to building for the Web.</p>

<p>But let’s look at some of the questions he says we don’t answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wait, how often do people turn off JavaScript?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Folks turning off JavaScript isn’t really the issue. It used to be, but that was years ago. I discussed <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/progressive-misconceptions/">the misconception that this is still a concern</a> a few weeks ago. The real issue is whether ot not JavaScript is available. Obviously your project may vary, but <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">the UK government pegged their non-JavaScript usage at 1.1%</a>. The more interesting bit, however, was that only 0.2% of their users fell into the “Javascript off or no JavaScript support” camp. 0.9% of their users <em>should have</em> gotten the JavaScript-based enhancement on offer, but didn’t. <a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html">The potential reasons are myriad</a>. JavaScript is great, but you can’t assume it’ll be available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m not trying to be mean, but I don’t think people in Sudan are going to buy my product.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t really a question, but it is the kinda thing I hear every now and then. An even more aggressive and ill-informed version I got was “I sell TVs; blind people don’t watch TV”. As a practical person, I’m willing to admit that your organization probably knows its market pretty well. If your products aren’t available in certain regions, it’s probably not worth your while to cater to folks in that region. But here’s some additional food for thought:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When you remove barriers to access for one group, you create opportunities for others.</strong> A perfect example of this is the curb cut. Curb cuts were originally created to facilitate folks in wheelchairs getting across the road. In creating curb cuts, we’ve also enabled kids to ride bicycles more safely on the sidewalk, delivery personnel to more easily move large numbers of boxes from their trucks into buildings, and parents to more easily cross streets with a stroller. Small considerations for one group pay dividends to more. What rational business doesn’t want to enable more folks to become customers?</li>
  <li><strong>Geography isn’t everything.</strong> I’m not as familiar with specific design considerations for Sudanese users, but since about 97% of Sudanese people are Muslim, let’s tuck into that. Ignoring translations and right-to-left text, let’s just focus on cultural sensitivity. For instance, a photo of a muscular, shirtless guy is relatively acceptable in much of the West, but <a href="http://www.instantshift.com/2015/04/23/website-designs-for-various-cultures/">would be incredibly offensive to a traditional Muslim population</a>. Now your target audience may not be 100% Muslim (nor may your content lend itself to scantily-clad men), but if you are creating sites for mass consumption, knowing this might help you art direct the project better and build something that doesn’t offend potential customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reach is incredibly important for companies and is something the Web enables quite easily. To squander that—whether intentionally or not—would be a shame.</p>

<h2 id="failures-of-understanding">Failures of understanding</h2>

<p>Josh spends the next section discussing what he views as failures of the argument for progressive enhancement. He’s of course, still debating it as a purely moral argument, which I think I’ve disproven at this point, but let’s take a look at what he has to say…</p>

<p>The first “fail” he casts on progressive enhancement proponents is that we “are wrong about what’s actually on the Web.” Josh offers three primary offerings on the Web:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation">
<ul><li>Business and personal software, both of which have exploded in use now that <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software has eaten the world</a> and is accessed primarily via the web</li><li>Copyrighted news and entertainment content (text, photos, music, video, video games)</li><li>Advertising and marketing content</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the fundamental issue with seeing the Web only through the kens of your own experience. Of course he would list software as the number one thing on the Web—I’m sure he uses Basecamp, Harvest, GitHub, Slack, TeamWork, Google Docs, Office 365, or any of a host of business-related Software as a Service offerings every day. As a beneficiary of fast network speeds, I’m not at all surprised that entertainment is his number two: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go/Now… It’s great to be financially-stable and live in the West. And as someone who works at a web agency, of course advertising would be his number three. A lot of the work Viget, and most other agencies for that matter, does is marketing-related; nothing wrong with that. <strong>But the Web is so much more than this.</strong> Here’s just a fraction of the stuff he’s overlooked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eCommerce,</li>
  <li>Social media,</li>
  <li>Banks,</li>
  <li>Governments,</li>
  <li>Non-profits,</li>
  <li>Small businesses,</li>
  <li>Educational institutions,</li>
  <li>Research institutions,</li>
  <li>Religious groups,</li>
  <li>Community organizations, and</li>
  <li>Forums.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s hard to find figures on anything but porn—which incidentally accounts for <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-23030090">somewhere between 4% and 35% of the Web</a>, depending on who you ask—but I have to imagine that these categories he’s overlooked probably account for the vast majority of “pages” on the Web even if they don’t account for the majority of traffic on it. Of course, as of 2014, <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/majority-web-traffic-comes-robots-180950398/">the majority of traffic on the Web was bots</a>, so…</p>

<p>The second “fail” he identifies is that our “concepts of universal access and moral imperatives… make no sense” in light of “fail” number one. He goes on to provide a list of things he seems to think we want even though advocating for progressive enhancement (and even universal access) doesn’t mean advocating for any of these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>All software and copyrighted news/entertainment content accessed via the web should be free.</em> and <em>Netflix, Spotify, HBO Now, etc. should allow anyone to download original music and video files because some people don’t have JavaScript.</em> I’ve never heard anyone say that… ever. Advocating a smart development philosophy doesn’t make you anti-copyright or against making money.</li>
  <li><em>Any content that can’t be accessed via old browsers/devices shouldn’t be on the web in the first place.</em> No one made that judgement. We just think it behooves you to increase the potential reach of your products and to have a workable fallback in case the ideal access scenario isn’t available. You know, smart business decisions.</li>
  <li><em>Everything on the web should have built-in translations into every language.</em> This would be an absurd idea given that the number of languages in use on this planet top 6,500. Even if you consider that 2,000 of those have less than 1,000 speakers it’s still absurd. I don’t know anyone who would advocate for translation to every language.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li><em>Honda needs to consider a universal audience for its marketing websites even though (a) its offline advertising is not universal, and (b) only certain people can access or afford the cars being advertised.</em> To you his first point, Honda does actually offline advertising in multiple languages. They even <a href="](http://news.honda.com/newsandviews/article.aspx?id=8340-en)">issue press releases mentioning it</a>: “The newspaper and radio advertisements will appear in Spanish or English to match the primary language of each targeted media outlet.” As for his second argument… making assumptions about target audience and who can or cannot afford your product seems pretty friggin’ elitist; it’s also incredibly subjective. For instance, we did a project for a major investment firm where we needed to support Blackberry 4 &amp; 5 even though there were many more popular smartphones on the market. The reason? They had several high-dollar investors who loved their older phones. You can’t make assumptions.</li>
  <li><em>All of the above should also be applied to offline software, books, magazines, newspapers, TV shows, CDs, movies, advertising, etc.</em> Oh, I see, he’s being intentionally ridiculous.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m gonna skip the third fail since it presumes morality is the only argument progressive enhancement has and then chastises the progressive enhancement community for not spending time fighting for equitable Internet access and net neutrality and against things like censorship (which, of course, many of us actually do).</p>

<hr />

<p>In his closing section, Josh talks about progressive enhancement moderates and he quotes <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-future-of-the-web">Matt Griffin on <cite>A List Apart</cite></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing that needs to be considered when we’re experimenting … is who the audience is for that thing. Will everyone be able to use it? Not if it’s, say, a tool confined to a corporate intranet. Do we then need to worry about sub-3G network users? No, probably not. What about if we’re building on the open web but we’re building a product that is expressly for transferring or manipulating HD video files? Do we need to worry about slow networks then? … Context, as usual, is everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, <em>it depends</em>, which is what we’ve all been saying all along.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with these facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Progressive enhancement has many benefits, not the least of which are resilience and reach.</li>
  <li>You don’t have to like or even use progressive enhancement, but that doesn’t detract from its usefulness.</li>
  <li>If you ascribe to progressive enhancement, you may have a project (or several) that aren’t really good candidates for it (e.g., online photo editing software).</li>
  <li>JavaScript is a crucial part of the progressive enhancement toolbox.</li>
  <li>JavaScript availability is never guaranteed, so it’s important to consider offering fallbacks for critical tasks.</li>
  <li>Progressive enhancement is neither moral nor amoral, it’s just a smart way to build for the Web.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is progressive enhancement necessary to use on every project?</p>

<p><em>No.</em></p>

<p>Would users benefit from progressive enhancement if it was followed on more sites than it is now?</p>

<p><em>Heck yeah.</em></p>

<p>Is progressive enhancement right for your project?</p>

<p><em>It depends.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, my colleague<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/">Nolan Lawson</a> wrote <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2016/10/13/progressive-enhancement-isnt-dead-but-it-smells-funny/">a lengthy post about his struggles with progressive enhancement</a>. In it, he identified a key tension between the JavaScript community and the progressive enhancement community that has, frankly, existed since the term “progressive enhancement” was coined some 13 years ago. I wanted to take a few minutes to tuck into that tension and assure Nolan and other folks within the JS community that neither progressive enhancement nor the folks who advocate it (like me) is at odds with them or their work.</p>

<p>But first let’s take a a trip back in time to 2003. In March of that year, <a href="http://hesketh.com/publications/inclusive_web_design_for_the_future.html">Steve Champion introduced a concept he called “progressive enhancement”</a>. It caused a bit of an upheaval at the time because it challenged the dominant philosophy of graceful degradation. Just so we’re all on the same page, I’ll compare these two philosophies.</p>

<h2 id="whats-graceful-degradation">What’s graceful degradation?</h2>

<p><em>Graceful degradation</em> assumes that an experience is going to be worse on older, less capable browsers and devices. To address potential problems, it recommends that developers take steps to avoid throwing errors—JavaScript or otherwise—for their users. Under this philosophy, a developer can take a range of approaches ranging from making everything work perfectly in down-level browsers to only addressing egregious errors or even chosing to block certain browsers from accessing the content if they are known to have problems. We saw this latter approach often with Flash-only sites, but it wasn’t limited to them. I used <a href="#2016-10-17-1">this “roadblock” example from Kodak.com</a> in <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/">my book</a>:</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-10-17-1" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-10-17/kodak-roadblock.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-10-17/kodak-roadblock.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-10-17/kodak-roadblock.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-10-17/kodak-roadblock.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""></figure>

<p>Overall, graceful degradation is about risk avoidance. The problem was that it created a climate on the Web where we, as developers, got comfortable with the idea of denying access to services (e.g., people’s bank accounts) because we deemed a particular browser (or browsers) too difficult to work with. Or, in many cases, we just didn’t have the time or budget (or both) to address the broadest number of browsers. It’s kind of hard to reconcile the challenge of cross-browser development in 2003 with what we are faced with today as we were only really dealing with 2-3 browsers back then, but you need to remember that standards support was far worse at the time.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-progressive-enhancement">So what’s progressive enhancement?</h2>

<p>In his talk, Steve upended the generally shared perspective that older browsers deserved a worse experience because they were less technically capable. He asked us to look beyond the browsers and the technologies in play and focus on the user experience, challenging us to design inclusive experiences that would work in the broadest of scenarios. He asked that we focus on the content and core tasks in a given interface and then enhance the experience when we could. We accomplish this by layering experiences on top of one another, hence “progressive enhancement”.</p>

<p>What’s particularly interesting about this approach is that it is still technically graceful degradation because all of the interfaces do gracefully fall back to a usable state. But it’s graceful degradation at its best, focused on delivering a good experience to everyone. No excuses.</p>

<p>To give a simple example, consider a form field for entering your email address. If we were to mark it up like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="email" name="email" id="email"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I automatically create layers of experience with no extra effort:</p>

<ol>
<li>Browsers that don’t understand “email” as a valid <code>input</code> type will treat the “email” text as a typo in my HTML (like when you type “rdio” instead of “radio”… or maybe I’m the only one that does that). As a result, they will fall back to the default input type of “text”, which is usable in every browser that supports HTML2 and up.</li>
<li>Browsers that consider “email” a valid <code>input</code> type will provide one (or more) of many potential enhanced experiences:
<ol type="a">
<li>In a virtual keyboard context, the browser may present a keyboard that is tailored toward quickly entering email addresses.</li>
<li>In a browser that supports auto-completion, it may use this as a cue to suggest entering a commonly-entered email or one that has been stored in the user’s profile.</li>
<li>In a browser that supports HTML5 validation, the browser may validate this field for proper email formatting when the user attempts to submit the form.</li>
<li>In a browser that does not support HTML5 validation or that doesn’t actively block submission on validation errors—<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28649">like Safari</a>—a developer-supplied JavaScript program may use the <code>type</code> attribute as a signal that it should validate the field for proper email address formatting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>That means that there are between 5 and 13 potential experiences (given all of the different possible combinations of these layers) in this one single single element… it’s kind of mind-boggling to think about, right? And the clincher here is that any of these experiences can be a good experience. Heck for nearly 15 years of the Web, the plain-ol’ text <code>input</code> was the only way we had for entering an email address. Anything better than that is gravy.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement embraces the idea of experience as a continuum rather than some singular ideal. It recognizes that every person is different and we all have special requirements for Web access. Some may depend on our browser, the device we’re on, and the network we are using. Others may be the result of a limitation we have dealt with since birth, are dealing with temporarily as the result of an injury or incident, or are simply a factor of our current situation. We all experience the world differently and progressive enhancement not only respects that, it embraces that variability.</p>

<p>How does it do this? Progressive enhancement takes advantage of the fault tolerant nature of HTML and CSS. It also uses JavaScript’s own ability to test for browser features to tailor programmatic enhancements to the given device and situation. That’s right: progressive enhancement and JavaScript go hand-in-hand.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-so-many-javascript-folks-hostile-to-progressive-enhancement">Why are so many JavaScript folks hostile to progressive enhancement?</h2>

<p>As a member of the JavaScript community for over a decade now, I have theory for why many JavaScript developers are so antagonistic toward progressive enhancement. Part of it has to do with history and part of it has to do with programming culture. Let’s tackle the history first.</p>

<p>When progressive enhancement was first proposed, the Web was getting more standardized, but things were still a bit of a mess… especially in the JavaScript world. Many JavaScript programs were poorly-written, contained lots of browser-specific code, and were generally unfriendly to anyone who fell outside of the relatively narrow band of “normal” Web use… like screen reader users, for example. It’s not surprising though: Graceful degradation was the name of the game at the time.</p>

<p>Because JavaScript programs were creating barriers for users who just wanted to read news articles, access public services, and check their bank accounts, many accessibility advocates recommended that these folks disable JavaScript in their browsers. By turning off JavaScript, the theory went, users would get clean and clear access to the content and tasks they were using the Web for. Of course that was in the days before Ajax, but I digress.</p>

<p>This recommendation served as a bit of a wake-up call for many JavaScript developers who had not considered alternate browsing experiences. Some chose to write it off and continued doing their own thing. Others, however, accepted the challenge of making JavaScript more friendly to the folks who relied on assistive technologies (AT). Many even went on to write code that actually improved the experience specifically for folks who are AT-dependent. Dojo and YUI, though sadly out of favor these days, were two massive libraries that prioritized accessibility. In fact, I’d go so far as to say they ushered in a period of alignment between JavaScript and accessibility.</p>

<p>Even though JavaScript and accessibility are no longer at odds (and really haven’t been for the better part of a decade), there are still some folks who believe they are. People routinely come across old articles that talk about JavaScript being inaccessible and they turn around and unfairly demonize JavaScript developers as unsympathetic toward folks who rely on screen readers or other AT. It’s no wonder that some JavaScript developers become immediately defensive when the subject of accessibility comes up… especially if it’s not something they’re all that familiar with.</p>

<hr />

<p>I also mentioned that programming culture plays a part in the antagonistic relationship between the progressive enhancement camp and the JavaScript community. If you’ve been a programmer for any amount of time, you’ve probably borne witness to the constant finger-pointing, belittling, and arrogance when it come to the languages we choose to program in or the tools we use to do it.</p>

<p>As a programmer, you receive a near constant barrage of commentary on your choices… often unsolicited. <em>You’re using PHP? That’s so 1996! You’re still using TextMate?! You still use jQuery? How quaint!</em> I’m not exactly sure where this all began, but it’s unhealthy and causes a lot of programmers to get immediately defensive when anyone challenges their language of choice or their process. And this hostile/defensive environment makes it very difficult to have a constructive conversation about best practices.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement should not be viewed as a challenge to JavaScript any more than concepts like <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch13s15.html">namespacing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test driven development</a>, or <a href="http://www.yottaa.com/company/blog/application-optimization/how-does-reducing-javascript-requests-minifying-javascript/">file concatenation &amp; minification</a> are; it’s just another way to improve your code. That said, progressive enhancement does introduce a wrinkle many for hardcore JavaScript programmers seem unwilling to concede: JavaScript is fragile. At least on the client side, JavaScript development requires far more diligence when it comes to error handling and fallbacks than traditional programming because, unlike with traditional software development, <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/a-fundamental-disconnect/">we don’t control the execution environment</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a> (in)famously declared the Web “the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable” and he wasn’t wrong. A lot of things have to go right for our code to reach our users precisely the way we intend. Here are just a few of these requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our code must be bug-free;</li>
  <li>Included 3rd party code must be bug free and must not interfere with our code;</li>
  <li>Intermediaries—ISPs, routers, etc.—must not inject code or if they do, it must be bug free and not interfere with our code;</li>
  <li>Browser plugins must not interfere with our code;</li>
  <li>The browser must support every language feature and API we want to use; and</li>
  <li>The device must have enough RAM and a fast enough processor to run our code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of these can be addressed by programming defensively using test-driven development, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/simonguest/automated-web-testing-using-javascript">automated QA testing</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Using_Web_Standards_in_your_Web_Pages/Developing_cross-browser_and_cross-platform_pages#Using_Object.2FFeature_support_detection_approach:_best_and_overall_most_reliable">feature detection</a>, and markup detection. These aren’t guaranteed to catch everything—markup can change after a test has run but before the rest of the code executed, <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-objects-in-detail/">JavaScript objects are mutable</a> meaning features can accidentally disappear, etc.—but they are incredibly helpful for creating robust JavaScript programs. You can also run your projects under HTTPS to avoid intermediaries manipulating your code, though <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/01/gogo-issues-fake-https-certificate-to-users-visiting-youtube/">that’s not fool-proof either</a>.</p>

<p>The devices themselves, we have no control over. It’s not like we can send a new device to each and every user (or prospective user) we have just to ensure they have the appropriate hardware and software requirements to use our product.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Instead, we need to <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/writing-fast-memory-efficient-javascript/">write JavaScript programs that play well in a multitude of of scenarios (including resource-limited ones)</a>.</p>

<p>And, of course, none of this addresses network availability. In many instances, a user’s network connection has the greatest impact on their experience of our products. If the connection is slow (or the page’s resources are exceptionally large) the page load experience can be excruciatingly painful. If the connection goes down and dependencies aren’t met, the experience can feel disjointed or may be flat out broken. Using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">Service Worker</a> and client-side storage (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API"><code>indexedDB</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">Web Storage</a>) can definitely help mitigate these issues for repeat visits, but they don’t do much to help with initial load. They also don’t work at all if your JavaScript program doesn’t run. Which brings me to my last point.</p>

<p>When you love a language like JavaScript (as I do), it can be difficult to recognize (or even admit) it’s shortcomings, but recognizing them is part of becoming a better programmer. The Web is constantly evolving and our understanding of the languages we use to build it expands as fast as—or often faster than—their capabilities do. As such, we need to remain open to new and different ways of doing things. Change can be scary, but it can also be good. Being asked to consider a non-JavaScript experience shouldn’t be seen as an affront to JavaScript, but rather a challenge to create more robust experiences. After all, our last line of defense in providing a good user experience is providing one with <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/developing-dependency-awareness/">the least number of dependencies</a>. That’s what progressive enhancements asks us to do.</p>

<h2 id="javascript--pe-kissing-in-a-tree">JavaScript &amp; PE kissing in a tree?</h2>

<p>All of this is to say I don’t think JavaScript and progressive enhancement are diametrically opposed and I don’t think folks who love the JavaScript language or tout the progressive enhancement philosophy should be either. Together they have the potential to making the Web the best it can possibly be.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement’s focus on providing a baseline experience that makes no assumptions about browser features will provide a robust foundation for any project. It also guides us to be smarter about <em>how</em> we apply technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ARIA by asking us to consider what happens when those dependencies aren’t met.</p>

<p>JavaScript absolutely makes the user experience better for anyone who can benefit from it. It can make interfaces more accessible. It can help mitigate networking issues. It can create smoother, more seamless experiences for our users. And it can reduce the friction inherent in accomplishing most tasks on the Web. JavaScript is an indispensable part of the modern Web.</p>

<p>In order to come together, however, folks <a href="https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/notes/debating-web-development/">need to stop demonizing and dismissing one another</a>. Instead we need to rally together to make the Web better. But before we can do that, we need to start with a common understanding of the nature of JavaScript. The progressive enhancement camp needs to concede that all JavaScript is not evil, or even bad—JavaScript can be a force for good and it’s got really solid support. The JavaScript camp needs to concede that, despite its ubiquity and near universal support, we can never be absolutely guaranteed our JavaScript programs will run.</p>

<p>I fully believe we can heal this rift, but it’s probably gonna take some time. I fully intend to do my part and I hope you will as well.</p>

    <updated>2016-08-17T14:48:27-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/what-would-you-do-with-10kb</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sixteen years ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/stewart">Stewart Butterfield</a> conceived of a contest that would test the mettle of any web designer: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000510010054/http:/www.sylloge.com/5k/home.html">The 5k</a>. The idea was that entrants would build <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/5k">an entire site in 5kB of code or less</a>. Its aim was to force us to get creative by putting a bounding box on what we could do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between servers and bandwidth, clients and users, HTML and the DOM, browsers and platforms, our conscience and our ego, we’re left in a very small space to find highly optimal solutions. Since the space we have to explore is so small, we have to look harder, get more creative; and that’s what makes it all interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- more -->

<p>The 5k contest ran from 2000 until 2002. In 2010, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2010/07/29/10k-apart-%E2%80%93%C2%A0inspire-the-web/">An Event Apart and Microsoft revived the idea</a> with an updated limit and a new name: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100730090946/http:/10k.aneventapart.com/">10k Apart</a>. Staying true to its roots, this new incarnation, which ran for two years, continued to push designers and developers to get creative within a pretty extreme (though slightly expanded) limit while incorporating new goodies like HTML5 and responsive design.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled to announce that <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/">the 10k Apart contest is back</a> and brings with it a handful of new challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Each page must be usable in 10kB or less.</strong> The 10kB limit no longer applies to the size of a ZIP archive of your entry; the 10kB limit now applies to the total initial download size of the baseline experience of each page in your project. When we say “baseline experience,” we’re talking small screen devices running older, less capable browsers. The 10kB limit will apply to every page and whatever assets it loads by default; that means images, CSS, JavaScript, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Progressive enhancement is the name of the game.</strong> Your project should start with a super-basic, bare-bones-but-usable experience that will work no matter what (including without JavaScript). You can use clever CSS and JavaScript techniques to enhance that experience as it makes sense to do so. For example: You might lazy load an image using JavaScript if the screen size is above a certain threshold or when certain other conditions are met. Entries that depend entirely on JavaScript to render the front-end won’t be accepted. If you need a primer on progressive enhancement, <a href="http://alistapart.com/search?keywords=progressive%20enhancement">consult the pages of <cite>A List Apart</cite></a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Back ends are in this year.</strong> In previous iterations, each entry comprised client-side code submitted via ZIP file. Over time, that limitation led to an over-reliance on JavaScript for rendering. No more. This year, you can create dynamic experiences that work without front-end JavaScript using Node, PHP, Python or .Net. You will submit your entry as public GitHub repository (so we can all learn from your awesome code) and we’ll spin up a dedicated <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Azure</a> instance running the appropriate stack.</li>
  <li><strong>Entries should be accessible.</strong> In line with the philosophy of progressive enhancement, your entry should be usable by the broadest number of users possible. <a href="http://www.accessiq.org/news/commentary/2012/09/web-accessibility-is-a-mindset-not-a-checklist">Accessibility is not a checklist</a>, but if you’re clueless about where to start, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">these techniques</a> can offer some guidance.</li>
  <li><strong>Nothing comes for free.</strong> In previous years, we gave a pass if you wanted to use jQuery or load some fonts from Typekit. This year we decided to change it up, not because we don’t love these products (we do), but because we wanted to force every piece of code, every asset, to fight for its place in your entry. Anything you add should be added with purpose.</li>
</ol>

<p>As with previous editions, your entry should use web standards and work in all modern browsers. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features and APIs that don’t have across-the-board support as long as you do so in keeping with the progressive enhancement philosophy. In other words, your entry can’t depend on that technology or feature in order to be usable.</p>

<p>All of this may sound like a tall order, but it’s entirely possible. In fact, the site we built for the contest also abides by these rules. My colleagues and I will touch on some of the techniques we used (and concessions we made) in building the site in future posts.</p>

<p>If you’ve read this far, you might be wondering <em>What’s in it for me?</em> Well, bragging rights, of course, but we’ve got some awesome prizes too! We’re giving away $10,000 to the top three entries, plus <a href="http://aneventapart.com/events">tickets to An Event Apart</a>, complete collections of <a href="https://abookapart.com/collections/standards-collection">A Book Apart titles</a>, and copies of <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/">my book</a> too. <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/#prizes">Complete details of the prizes</a> are over on <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/">the contest site</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve lined up an amazing group to judge the entires this year too: <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lara_hogan">Lara Hogan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto">Mat Marquis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Heydonworks">Heydon Pickering</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jensimmons">Jen Simmons</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan">Sara Soueidan</a> will all be putting your entry through its paces and peering under the hood at your code. There’s also a People’s Choice award which will be based on votes you cast. Voting will open October 1st and run through October 14th.</p>

<p>The contest opened Monday and we will accept entries until 5pm Pacific Time on September 30th. <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/legal">Everything you should need to know about the contest, eligibility, etc.</a> is up on <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/">the 10k Apart site</a>, but if you have additional questions, <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/hi">you can always reach out</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what you come up with! Happy coding!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In two back-to-back, potentially <abbr aria-label="Not Safe for Work">NSFW</abbr> posts discussing web development vs. native development, <a href="https://hueniverse.com">Eran Hammer</a> covered a lot of the pain points encountered in each. For instance, on the Web, you’ve got rendering and user interface inconsistencies between browsers. On the other hand, retention for native apps is notoriously crappy.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Toward the end of his second piece, Eran nailed my long-time contention in this quasi-fictional war between the Web and native:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s never really app vs native. It’s a complicated tradeoff between multiple factors and no matter how much you read about it, how many statistics you collect, how many experts you talk to, you will still have to figure it out on your own, based on the specific properties of the experience you are building. And keep evaluating your decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with everything, the right choice often depends on a variety of factors, many of which are likely to change.</p>

<p>In the end, I typically fall down on the side of the Web because I find its “messy” nature to be one of its great strengths. The Web is malleable and capable of being different things for different people. This flexibility allows it to travel further and empower more people than native apps ever will. I guess that’s why I am so stoked about progressive web apps too. When done well, they enable useful tools to go further and reach more people while providing many of the benefits of an installed application. If they’re successful, they really could be the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Anyway, both posts are well worth a read:</p>

    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/the-web-should-just-work-for-everyone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>I had the great pleasure of delivering the following talk at the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/edgesummit/">Edge Web Summit</a> on April 4th. The talk is largely about accessibility with a push for thinking about the future of the interface and how considering accessibility now will help us prepare for a world of “headless UIs”.</em></p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p>We, as an industry, tend to have a pretty myopic view of experience. Those of us who work day-to-day in accessibility probably have a broader perspective than most, but I would argue that even we all fall short now and again when it comes to seeing the Web as others do.</p>

<p>I’m, of course, talking about accessibility. Now if you’re like most audiences, I’m guessing when you hear the word “accessibility” you probably think “screen reader”. That’s ok. Screen readers are certainly one part of the assistive technology spectrum, but my hope is, that by the end of this talk, when someone says “accessibility” you instead think… “opportunity”.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-04-11-01" class="media-container"><img src="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-04-11/01.gif" alt="The word “Accessibility” exploding to reveal the word “opportunity”." /></figure>

<p>Accessibility is concerned with accommodating disabilities, but our understanding of what a disability is has changed over time. In the 1980s, the World Health Organization defined a disability as a personal attribute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the context of health experience, a disability is any restriction or lack of ability (resulting from an impairment) to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have since <a href="http://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/">updated their definition of a disability</a> to be more context-dependent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disability is not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The points of interaction between a person and society are where disability happens. It’s our responsibility to know how our designs affect these interactions.</p>

<p>If we use our own abilities and biases as a starting point, we end up with products designed for people of a specific age, language ability, tech literacy, and physical ability. Plus those with specific access to money, time, and stable network connections.</p>

<figcaption>A figurative graph charting user ability against population using a bunch of different icons for people. One person is identified as a designer and she is part of a subset of the people that are in grey, signifying that they are "included" when the designer considers things from their own perspective. The vast majority of the people icons are in red, signifying they are "excluded" by this line of thinking.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When it comes to people, there’s no such thing as “normal”. For example, the interactions we design with technology depend heavily on what we can see, hear, say, and touch. If we’re designing with ourselves as a baseline, we can overlook people with circumstances different from ours.</p>

<p>I love exercises that create opportunities for revelation. One of my favorites originates from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls">John Rawls</a>. Rawls was a philosopher who used to run a social experiment with students, church groups, and the like. In the experiment, individuals were allowed to create their ideal society. It could follow any philosophy. It could be a monarchy or democracy or anarchy. It could be capitalist or socialist. The people in this experiment had free rein to control absolutely every facet of the society… but then he’d add the twist: They could not control what position they occupied in that society.</p>

<p>This twist is what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harsanyi">John Harsanyi</a>—an early game theorist—refers to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance">“Veil of Ignorance”</a> and what Rawls found, time and time again, was that individuals participating in the experiment would gravitate toward creating the most egalitarian societies.</p>

<p>It makes sense: what rational, self-interested human being would treat the elderly, the sick, people of a particular gender or race or creed or color, poorly if they could find themselves in that position?</p>

<p>We’re often told accessibility is only concerned with folks with “special needs.” Well news flash: <em>we all have special needs</em>. Some we’re born with. Some we develop. Some are temporary. Some have nothing to do with us personally, but are situational or purely dependent on the hardware we are using, the interaction methods we have available to us, or even the speed at which we can access the Internet or process data.</p>

<p>Sometimes disability is a temporary thing. A short-term injury and illness affect the way people interact with the world around them. Looking into bright light can cause brief visual impairment. Being sick with a cough makes it hard to speak. Wearing a cast can severely limit a person’s ability to lift an everyday object.</p>

<p>On the more technical side of things, small touchscreens can be awkward to interact with is you’re fat-fingered like me. Glossy screens can be difficult to read under glaring light. Low-contrast text can be difficult to read when you turn the screen brightness down to conserve battery life on your mobile device.</p>

<p>Recognizing that we all have special needs leads us to make better decisions as designers and developers. When we understand that disability is a universal and dynamic way of interacting with the world, it can become something else as well: a new source for creativity. Our impact can also expand, as our inclusive designs reach a greater number of people.</p>

<p>Designing for people with permanent disabilities can seem like a significant constraint, but the resulting designs can actually benefit a much larger number of people. For example, curb cuts in sidewalks were first created to make it safer and easier for people in wheelchairs to cross the street.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-04-11-03" class="media-container">

<p>But curb cuts also help people with a wide range of circumstances, from kids riding bicycles, to parents pushing strollers, to workers hauling heavy equipment.</p>

<p>Similarly, high-contrast screen settings were initially made to benefit people with vision impairments. But today, many people benefit from high-contrast settings when they use a device in bright sunlight. The same is true for remote controls, automatic door openers, voice controls, and much more. Designing with constraints in mind is simply designing well.</p>

</figure>

<p>By designing for someone with a permanent disability, someone with a situational disability can also benefit. For example, a device designed for a person who has one arm could be used just as effectively by a person with a temporary wrist injury or a new parent holding an infant.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-04-11-06" class="media-container">
<img alt="Adding up the number of people in the U.S. who deal with disabilities relating to arm usage gets your to 21 million pretty quickly."  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-04-11/06.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-04-11/06.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-04-11/06.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-04-11/06.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw">
</figure>

<p>Being mindful of the continuum from permanent to situational disabilities helps us rethink how our designs can scale to more people in new ways. In the United States, 26,000 people a year suffer from loss of upper extremities.</p>

<p>But when we include people with temporary and situational disabilities, the number is greater than 20M.</p>

<p>As a web design philosophy, progressive enhancement is right in line with the egalitarian inclusive design approach. It calls for equality of opportunity, but doesn’t require equality of outcome. It’s okay for different folks to experience your products in different ways as long as everyone can accomplish the task they set out to do.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://benhoh.com/journal/2012/01/30/from-degradation-to-enhancement">Ben Hoh eloquently put it</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Progressive enhancement] keeps the design open to the possibilities of sexiness in opportune contexts, rather than starting with the ‘whole’ experience that must be compromised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At its essence, progressive enhancement is about being good designers. The definition of design is “to devise for a specific function or end” Classically, it means “to indicate” and comes from the medieval Latin: <i lang="la">designare</i>, meaning “to mark out”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been amazed at how often those outside the discipline of design assume that what designers do is decoration—likely because so much bad design simply is decoration. Good design isn’t. Good design is problem solving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Jeff Veen so astutely observed in <a href="http://www.inspireux.com/2009/01/19/good-design-isnt-decoration-good-design-is-problem-solving/">this quote</a>, there is a lot of bad “design” out there that is more concerned with aesthetics than problem solving.</p>

<p>When we are concerned with the user interface, it can sometimes be at the expense of the user experience.</p>

<p>This example hints at a simple reality: <strong>Every interface is a conversation</strong>. We engage our users directly in an effort to inform them, entertain them, or persuade them to act in a particular way. How this conversation goes directly affects the experience our users have.</p>

<p>Now this may sound great as a quote to share on Twitter—feel free—but it’s absolutely true. And it’s going to become even more important that we pay attention to this conversation as personal assistants—you know, “assistive technology”, it’s right there in the name—begins to play a larger part in our users’ lives.</p>

<p>We need to consider the experience when our products are stripped to their essence. When there is no visual design to entice our users to overlook the fundamental flaws in the design of our interfaces. When there is no UI to help them manage the cognitive load of accomplishing a given task.</p>

<p>Considering this now will put you way ahead of your competition and empower your users to do more with your products. It can seem like a daunting task when we’ve spent so much time fixated on how to enable our users to accomplish key tasks on a screen, especially in a responsive context. But what is responsive design about if not accessibility? Responsive design is concerned with presenting the most appropriate visual experience given the constraints of a screen’s size.</p>

<p>Similarly, conversational interfaces are concerned with the way we communicate with our users, whether there is a screen or not and whether the user can see it or not. This isn’t new, it’s a challenge we’ve tackled before…</p>

<p>Let’s take a trip back in time to one of the earliest computer games: Zork. Zork was written between 1977 and 1979. It’s a text-based adventure game that operates a lot like a game of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>—with the program serving the role of gamemaster.</p>

<p>As you move from location to location throughout the game, the program describes the environment and notes objects and people you can interact with. You type what you want to do and the program tells you the results of your actions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>West of House<br /> You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.<br /> There is a small mailbox here.<br /><br />&gt; <strong>open mailbox</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As this was the early days of computer gaming, you might think Zork’s interactions would be simple noun-verb combinations—”kill troll”—but Zork was more sophisticated than that. Its parser was could understand far more complex commands like “hit the troll with the Elvish sword”. This made the experience far more natural, as if you were playing a table top game with friends.</p>

<p>Whether Zork or a webpage, <strong>every interface is a conversation</strong>. When I create a homepage, I’m talking to visitors as if we’ve just met. I’m explaining what they can do on my site (and, in some cases, why it matters). If I’m designing a product page, the conversation is a little different. I’m explaining to my users what a particular object or service is, what it does, and how it will benefit them. I’ll skip the BS sales pitch and talk honestly about the product’s benefits. If I’m designing a contact form, I want to help my users get a message to me quickly and efficiently. I’m also going to set some expectations around how long it will take me to get back to them (and, of course, I’ll need to abide by that promise). Even the humble status update is a conversation. I’m asking a question and then stepping back and letting my users speak. The floor is theirs. (But I’m probably mining what they say for data so I can market to them later.)</p>

<p>Conversations consist of words, so it should come as no surprise that we should choose our words carefully. When talking to people, things generally go better when you talk to them like they talk to you. This is a lesson Facebook learned the (somewhat) hard way.</p>

<p>Over the 2011 holidays, Facebook users were uploading photos like crazy. In the span of a few days, Facebook processed more photo uploads than are contained in the entirety of Flickr. Seriously, that’s a lot of photos.</p>

<p>One unintended consequence of this deluge of photo uploads was a significant uptick in people asking Facebook to remove specific ones. Facebook received millions of these “photo reports”, but they made no sense: Moms holding babies reported for harassment, pictures of puppies reported for hate speech, and so on. Roughly 97% of these photo reports were dramatically mis-categorized.</p>

<p>Facebook’s engineers reached out to some of the users who had reported these photos to get a bit more background regarding their submissions.</p>

<p>At the time Facebook’s photo reporting interface provided a list of reasons users could choose from if they wanted a photo removed, but, as Facebook soon discovered, many of the reports were made because users didn’t want the photo posted for reasons other than those provided.</p>

<p>In some cases, it was because they didn’t like how they looked in the photo. In others, it was because the photo was of an ex-partner or even a beloved pet they’d shared with an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend. The existing photo reporting tool had not done a good job of accounting for these more personal reasons for wanting a photo removed, so the Facebook engineers went to work. They added a step that asked <em>How does this photo make you feel?</em> The options were simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embarrassing</li>
  <li>Upsetting</li>
  <li>Saddening</li>
  <li>Bad Photo</li>
  <li>Other</li>
</ul>

<p>The “other” option also provided a free-response text field to fill in.</p>

<p>With this system in place, they found that 50% of reporters who answered the new question chose one of the provided options. That was pretty helpful, but there was still a problem: 34% of the “other” respondents were writing “It’s embarrassing” in the blank rather than choosing the “embarrassing” option already provided.</p>

<p>What the Facebook team realized was that people were not identifying with the “embarrassing” text (or may have even thought it was referring to them, rather than assuming an implied “It’s”). A subtle shift in language was needed, so they changed the label to <em>Please describe the photo</em> and they updated the options to mirror how people actually talk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s embarrassing</li>
  <li>It’s a bad photo of me</li>
  <li>It makes me sad</li>
</ul>

<p>With this subtle change, they were able to increase the percentage of photo reporters who chose one of the options provided to a whopping 78%.</p>

<p>Words matter. Even in something as simple and banal as a form, the words we choose set the tone for our users’ experiences and often have an affect on what they do… or fail to do. The words we choose matter even more in the world of headless UIs. Without visual aids to help a user see where they are in a form or to aid them in managing the cognitive load of our interfaces, every bit of label and helper text becomes even more important.</p>

<p>When Luke Wroblewski coined “mobile first”, he told us to focus on the core purpose each and every page. He was, in essence, telling us to focus on the conversation we are having with our users. This approach pays huge dividends on small screens, but when it comes to voice-based interactions, “the page” doesn’t really exist. Experience is the sum of each individual interaction.</p>

<p>As part of their Alexa Skills Kit, Amazon offers a ton of recommendations for designing for voice, many of which happen to be equally useful for sighted users.</p>

<h2 id="write-for-people">Write for People</h2>

<p>We don’t author content for ourselves. We write for others. If what we write frustrated or alienates our users, we’ve failed at our job. In their profoundly helpful book <a href="http://amzn.to/1YpYLq1"><cite>Nicely Said</cite></a>, Nicole Fenton and Kate Kiefer Lee offer numerous suggestions for how to write with the reader in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be clear.</li>
  <li>Be concise.</li>
  <li>Be honest.</li>
  <li>Be considerate.</li>
  <li>Write how you speak.</li>
</ul>

<p>They also make the recommendation that you read your work aloud. As we head into the world of voice-based interactions, that’s beta testing!</p>

<h2 id="avoid-technical-and-legal-jargon">Avoid Technical and Legal Jargon</h2>

<p>For example, if you track error codes for issues on your site, send them to <em>your developers</em>, but never present them to a user. Similarly, we should avoid legalese and write in plain language. Medium has done a great job of this with <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f#.mgexdk816">their Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h2 id="when-requesting-feedback-make-it-clear-that-the-user-needs-to-respond">When Requesting Feedback, Make It Clear That the User Needs to Respond</h2>

<p>In perhaps the most common form example, consider the label “First Name”. It’s not terribly conversational and doesn’t beg for a response.</p>

<p>Similarly, when there’s an error, notify them of the error and, if possible, give them some clues on how to fix it.</p>

<h2 id="when-asking-a-user-to-choose-clearly-present-the-options">When Asking a User to Choose, Clearly Present the Options</h2>

<p>This comes into play often when dealing with forms. Ensuring radio and checkbox controls are properly associated with their labels is critical.</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/6f5b7c0f0c072631a908.js?file=radio-label.html"></script>

</p>

<p>You can also use the <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code> elements to group the related controls, but be sure to make the <code>legend</code> focusable or associate it with the first focusable form control in order to ensure the question is read out.</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/6f5b7c0f0c072631a908.js?file=fieldset.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;

  &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;agree&quot; id=&quot;agree_yes&quot;  value=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;

<p>We should strive for the same sort of clarity when presenting navigation options. The HTML5 <code>nav</code> element enables us to semantically identify an area of the page being used for navigation. It is not, however, always identified as being navigation when encountered naturally in the flow of the document. (It is when using role-based navigation like we saw earlier.) For that reason, it can be useful to provide an textual introduction to the section, even if you choose to visibly hide it. You might even consider expanding the text of your navigation items to provide additional context like I do on my site.</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/6f5b7c0f0c072631a908.js?file=navigation.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;nav id=&quot;nav&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;nav-title&quot;&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;b class=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;A Bit &lt;/b&gt;About&lt;b class=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt; Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<h2 id="prompts-should-be-short-while-still-being-clear">Prompts Should be Short, While Still Being Clear</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/files/On_The_Method_of_Theoretical_Physics.pdf">a 1933 lecture at Oxford</a>, Albert Einstein famously said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=prDfAFjet9cC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;ots=PA9rRog4cr&amp;dq=How%20a%20%E2%80%98Difficult%E2%80%99%20Composer%20Gets%20That%20Way&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Roger Sessions paraphrased it</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything should be as simple as it can be but not simpler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clear and concise writing is the hallmark of great content. We need to resist the urge to write for writing’s sake. We write in the service our audience, not for ourselves.</p>

<p>Government websites are some of the worst offenders in this area. Consider this lovely passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heavy rains throughout most of the State have given an optimistic outlook for lessened fire danger for the rest of the season. However, an abundance of lightning maintains a certain amount of hazard in isolated areas that have not received an excessive amount of rain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could be written far more clearly as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heavy rains throughout most of the State have lessened fire danger for the rest of the season. However, lightning threatens isolated dry areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the UK, the Government Digital Service has made great strides overhauling excruciatingly painful content and making it easier to read and understand. One such example is <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/28/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-things-simple/">their overhaul of the Accelerated Possession process</a> that allows landlords to evict a tenant.</p>

<p>The original paper form asked for the address like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The claimant seeks an order that the defendant(s) give possession of:<br /> (If the premises of which you seek possession are part of a building identify the part eg. Flat 3, Rooms 6 and 7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before requesting the type of property concerned</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(‘the premises’) which is<br /> ☐ a dwelling house<br /> ☐ part of a dwellinghouse</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clear and to the point, right?</p>

<p>The GDS went to work and streamlined the process in plain language:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What kind of property do you want to take back?<br /> ◎ A self-contained house, flat or bedsit<br /> ◎ Room or rooms in a property.<br /> Tenants may share kitchen or bathroom</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then they allow you to lookup the property or manually enter the address.</p>

<p>We show our users respect by respecting their time. Obviously straightforward, brief writing is one way we do that, but another is to reduce the time it takes to complete a task. Many forms are brimming with fields to be filled in. In some cases, the vast majority are purely optional. And while it may be easy to spot the required fields visually, bypassing them in an aural interface can be incredibly difficult.</p>

<p>User experience designers have been pushing for simplified forms since… well, as long as I can remember. Users appreciate them, they tend to result in better data, and they also tend to convert better than long forms. And when it comes to voice-based interactions, they will become a necessity. No one is going to want to spend 15 minutes working their way through a 15 question registration form when all that’s required is their email address and for them to choose a password.</p>

<figure id="figure-2016-03-04-12">

<p>On a similar note, we should avoid slicing fields into multiple parts if at all possible. For instance, you still see fields like this one, asking for a US phone number, quite often:</p>

<figure id="figure-2016-03-04-13">
<img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-03-04/13.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-03-04/13.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-03-04/13.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-03-04/13.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt="">
</figure>

<p>When interacting with this construct via voice, a user will be required to supply three separate values. In order to do so, each field would require a label. Most developers only know how to label the first of those three boxes and users would be really confused if you asked them for their exchange code and line number.</p>

<p>HTML5 introduced a host of new field types that consolidate phone numbers, dates, times, and other complex data types into single fields. Use them! As an added bonus, most enforce content validation and formatting rules for you automatically.</p>

<h3 id="present-information-in-consumable-pieces">Present Information in Consumable Pieces</h3>

<p>Like computers, we humans have a finite amount of “working memory”. The amount of mental resources required to operate an interface is called its “cognitive load”. When the amount of information we need to process exceeds our capacity to handle it, we can miss important details, have trouble concentrating, and become frustrated.</p>

<p>We deal with cognitive load in GUI design all the time, but in voice-based interactions, there are no visuals to act as signposts and provide reminders about where we are and what we’re doing. This is why it is critical to break complicated tasks down into simpler ones and eliminate excess noise (like non-required fields). We can also reduce cognitive load by chunking search results and other list-type content into small groups, asking the user if they want more before loading and presenting them.</p>

<hr />

<p>As human beings, we all have special needs, but as designers and developers, it can sometimes be difficult to diagnose potential issues within our products when it comes to accessibility. Especially if we don’t typically experience that need or are unfamiliar with the tools used to address it.</p>

<p>To that end, my colleagues have been hard at work to make it easier to enhance the accessibility of our products. The first tool I want to discuss is the F12 developer tools in Edge.</p>

<p>As Andy Sterland mentioned in his talk, in a forthcoming release of F12, the inspector will surface accessibility information about each node in the DOM. Let’s take a look at an example:</p>

<p><figure id="fig-Z0PSK4IUAVM" class="figure figure--video"><div class="video-embed video-embed--youtube video-embed--16x9"><a class="video-embed__lazy-link" style="background-image:url(//i2.ytimg.com/vi/Z0PSK4IUAVM/0.jpg);" href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0PSK4IUAVM" data-lazy-video-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Z0PSK4IUAVM?autoplay=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3"><div class="video-embed__lazy-div"></div><div class="video-embed__lazy-info">F12 Accessibility Inspector</div></a></div></figure></p>

<p>Here we have the forthcoming redesign of <a href="http://html5accessibility.com/">HTML5accessibility.com</a> and if I inspect the section containing the test results, I can see information about that section element. On the right hand side, you’ll notice an inspector tab dedicated to accessibility information such as the node’s accessible name, it’s role, whether it’s keyboard focusable, ARIA properties assigned to it (in this case, <code>aria-label</code>), and so on.</p>

<p>Adding this functionality into F12 lifts the veil from the way Edge exposes the DOM to assistive technology and will go a long way toward helping us fine tune our experiences for <abbr aria-label="assistive technology">AT</abbr>, including screen readers and virtual assistants.</p>

<p>Another area where we are doing some work is within Narrator itself. When testing with screen readers, it can be quite tempting as a sighted user, to leave your screen on so you can follow along. Sadly, that action directly prohibits you from experiencing a site or application the way folks with visual impairments or in a headless UI scenario do. It can cause you to miss things or assume something makes sense when, in fact, it doesn’t.</p>

<p>To help address that, Narrator will soon sport a “Developer Mode” that enables you to blank out a single app (such as the Edge browser window) so you can experience it without any visual access to the UI. (You can also use it for installed and hosted apps.)</p>

<p><figure id="fig-lJ-4AVxAIsc" class="figure figure--video"><div class="video-embed video-embed--youtube video-embed--16x9"><a class="video-embed__lazy-link" style="background-image:url(//i2.ytimg.com/vi/lJ-4AVxAIsc/0.jpg);" href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ-4AVxAIsc" data-lazy-video-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lJ-4AVxAIsc?autoplay=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3"><div class="video-embed__lazy-div"></div><div class="video-embed__lazy-info">Narrator Developer Mode</div></a></div></figure></p>

<p>Here we see the HTML5accessibility site again. If I flip on Developer Mode in Narrator, the Edge browser window goes black and I can see where the focus carat moves (the blue box), but I can’t see the design. For diagnostic purposes, the contents being read by Narrator are also presented as text on the screen in the position of the element (which can help with identifying where the issue was when you come back out of Developer Mode).</p>

<p>Microsoft is committed to improving the accessibility, not only of its own products, but of the Web as a whole. These two tools are only a few of the many ways we are doing that today.</p>

<p>Obviously, part of that is continuing to evolve and improve the accessibility of the Web for users browsing in Edge, whether they are using Narrator or other screen readers like Jaws or NVDA.</p>

<p>But, in addition to that, Microsoft—in partnership with Carnegie Mellon and Stanford, Adobe, AT&amp;T, Dropbox, Facebook, Intuit, LinkedIn, and Yahoo—helped launch <a href="http://teachaccess.org/">TeachAccess</a>. This site is an effort to address the “lack of awareness and understanding of basic accessibility issues, concepts and best practices” in the world of <abbr aria-label="computer science">CS</abbr> and <abbr aria-label="human-computer interaction">HCI</abbr> education. If successful, which I sincerely hope it is, it will help address the dire need we have for a more accessibility-aware workforce building for the Web.</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design">Microsoft Design</a> has shared <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/practice">their fantastic set of resources for improving the inclusiveness of design</a>. They have created a guide as well as a set of activities you can use to get your team into the <a href="http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/betterdesign2/whatis/whatis.html">Inclusive Design</a> mindset.</p>

<p>And in the not too distant future, we’ll be publishing a series of in-depth posts about accessibility on the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/">Microsoft Edge Dev Blog</a>. These will tackle topics like how we re-architected Edge for better ARIA support and name computation, working with HTML5 accessibility to improve the tests, and how we can enable automated testing in order to discover accessibility regressions before they make it into production.</p>

<p>We do this because, with accessibility in mind, we can improve the lives of billions of people. Friends, family, neighbors, and complete strangers, all of whom deserve the opportunity to access the products we create regardless of the different ways we experience the world.</p>

<p>Ultimately “accessibility” is not about disabilities or the technologies we use to address them, <strong>it’s about people</strong>. Sure, we’ll make it easier to look up movie times and purchase tickets to see the latest Transformers debacle, but we’ll also empower the nearly 900 million people globally—over 60% of whom are female—that are illiterate by enabling our sites to be used purely via voice, even translated in real-time into their native language and dialect.</p>

<p>We will create new opportunities for the poor and disadvantaged to participate in a world that has largely excluded them. You may not be aware, but 80% of Fortune 500 companies—think Target, Walmart—only accept job applications online or via computers.</p>

<p>We will enable people who have limited computer skills or who struggle with reading to apply for jobs with these companies.</p>

<p>We will empower immigrants to read lease agreements and postal mail in languages they haven’t fully grasped yet.</p>

<p>We will enable people with visual disabilities to vote, even on paper ballots, without human assistance.</p>

<p>We can help bridge the digital divide and the literacy gap. We can create opportunities for people to better their lives and the lives of their families. We have the power to create more equity in this world than most of us have ever dreamed.</p>

<p>This is an incredibly exciting time, not just for accessibility, not just for user experience, not just the Web, but for the world! I can’t wait to see how awesome you make it!</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
