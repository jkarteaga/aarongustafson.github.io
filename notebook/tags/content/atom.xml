    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think we can all agree, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> is a problem. A 2014 study by Harvard Law School determined that <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9282809&amp;fileId=S1472669614000255/">roughly 50% of the URLs referenced in U.S. Supreme Court opinions no longer work</a>. That’s <em>terrifying</em>.</p>

<p>When I was mid-way through writing <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/">the Second Edition of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite></a>, I realized that it was pretty likely some of the links I was referencing might disappear over the years. Little did I know, some of them would disappear <em>while I was writing the book!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/web/">The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a> is pretty good, but it doesn’t archive everything, and I often find captured pages end up broken—especially if they rely heavily JavaScript, but often images go missing as well. I wanted to make sure that when you pick up the book a year from now or even 10 years from now, the links will still work.</p>

<p>I evaluated a few options for creating a permanent archive of each and every link in the book (there are over 200), but then it dawned on me that <a href="https://perma.cc/">Perma.cc</a> might be the perfect answer.</p>

<p>Perma.cc was created by the <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a> in reaction to the paper I mentioned earlier. It is a distributed archive of URLs for scholarly and legal documents, supported not only by Harvard, but over 90 (<em>and counting!</em>) libraries, distributed all over the world. <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma">It’s also open source</a>. Each <a href="https://perma.cc/docs#archive-formats">URL is preserved as a live view, an archived view, and a screen capture</a> taken when the link is added. Archived URLs are kept for a minumum of 2 years, but <a href="https://perma.cc/docs#vesting-links">may be “vested” into the permanent archive by a member organization</a>.</p>

<p>I had contributed some CSS to the project a while back, so I reached out to my contacts to see if they might be interested in vesting all of the links for the book. Turns out they were big fans of <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/">the First Edition</a> and enthusiastically offered their support.</p>

<p>Converting all of the links took time (and a lot of double- and triple-checking), but the result is that every article, blog post, and web page that I referenced in the book will remain accessible to you in perpetuity. I think that’s pretty awesome. And, as an added bonus, since Perma.cc creates unique URLs that are relatively short, those of you who read it in print won’t have to re-type the often incredibly-lengthy original URLs.</p>

<p>I can’t thank <a href="http://mattphillips.info/">Matt Phillips</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/abziegler">Adam Ziegler</a>, <a href="http://jackcushman.org/">Jack Cushman</a>, and everyone else at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab enough for creating Perma.cc <em>and</em> for offering their service to my readers. You all are amazing!</p>

    <updated>2015-02-23T11:21:24-05:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While listening to <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/trust-engineers/">Radiolab’s “The Trust Engineers”</a>, I’ll admit I got a little excited when they started talking about web form performance. And no, not “performance” in the time-to-download sense, but “performance” in terms of how well the forms performed in attempting to capture meaningful, actionable data.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’ll set the scene: It’s the holiday season in 2011 and people are uploading photos to Facebook like crazy. In the span of a few days, Facebook processed more photo uploads than are contained in the entirety of Flickr. Seriously, that’s a lot of photos.</p>

<p>Anyway, one unintended consequence of this deluge of photo uploads was a significant uptick in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/189722821075378">photo reports</a>. Facebook received millions of them, but they made no sense: Moms holding babies reported for harassment, pictures of puppies reported for hate speech, and so on. Roughly 97% of these photo reports were miscategorized.</p>

<p>When Facebook engineers reached out to some of the users who had reported these photos for a bit more background behind their decisions, they discovered that many of the reports were because users didn’t want the photo on Facebook reasons other than the options provided. In some cases it was because they didn’t like how they looked in the photo and in others it was because the photo was of an ex or even a beloved pet they shared with an ex.</p>

<p>The existing photo reporting form had not done a good job of accounting for these more personal reasons for wanting a photo removed, so the Facebook engineers went to work. They added a step that asked <em>How does this photo make you feel?</em> The options were simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embarrassing</li>
  <li>Upsetting</li>
  <li>Saddening</li>
  <li>Bad Photo</li>
  <li>Other</li>
</ul>

<p>The “other” option also provided a free-response field to fill in.</p>

<p>With this system in place, they found that 50% of reporters would choose one of the provided options. That was pretty helpful, but there was still a problem: 34% of the “other” respondents were writing “It’s embarrassing” in the blank rather than choosing the “embarrassing” option already provided.</p>

<p>What they realized was that people were not identifying with the “embarrassing” text (or may have even thought it was referring to them, rather than assuming the implied “It’s”). A subtle shift in language was needed, so they changed the label to <em>Please describe the photo</em>. And they updated the options to mirror how people actually talk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s embarrassing</li>
  <li>It’s a bad photo of me</li>
  <li>It makes me sad</li>
</ul>

<p>With this subtle change, they were able to increase the percentage of photo reporters who chose one of the options provided to a whopping 78%.</p>

<p>Sometimes we feel compelled to create forms that are very clinical. In the survey world we’re often taught to limit the “personality” of our forms in order to avoid influencing the responses.</p>

<p>That said, we need to remember that we are authoring interfaces that will be used by actual people. When we are creating forms that don’t require that kind of scientific rigor, we can (and should) do whatever we can to make the interaction more human.</p>

<p>Ask real questions: <em>What’s your name?</em>, <em>What’s your email?</em>, and <em>How would you prefer we contact you?</em> are far more friendly than <em>Name</em>, <em>Email</em>, and <em>Contact Preference</em>.</p>

<p>A little thoughtful consideration for the people who need to fill in your form goes a long way toward making them feel at ease and also helps to ensure the feedback you receive is accurate, valuable, and actionable.</p>
