<p>Wow. It’s hard to believe it’s been that long. User #12,028 (back when they were still sequential).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>If memory serves, <a href="https://twitter.com/adactio">Jeremy Keith</a> was the first to suggest I join Twitter. Jeremy and I had met for the first time at SXSW in 2005 and became fast friends. That was the same year I met <a href="https://twitter.com/andybudd">Andy Budd</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/clagnut">Richard Rutter</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldman">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb">Eric Meyer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shauninman">Shaun Inman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenseninman">Leslie Jensen</a> (pre-Inman), <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria">Jason Santa Maria</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RobWeychert">Rob Weychert</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sil">Stuart Langridge</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/malarkey">Andrew (née Andy “Malarkey”) Clarke</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hicksdesign">Jon Hicks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/t">Tantek Çelik</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/goodwitch">Glenda Sims</a>, and so many more amazing (and influential) web designers. We became quite the posse and dutifully packed the mezzanine of the Hampton Inn each and every morning before the conference started and generally pal-ed around throughout the week. Then we all returned to our respective locales and prepared to do it all over again the next year.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I think Jeremy was the first to suggest I try out the burgeoning service our friends <a href="https://twitter.com/biz">Biz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ev">Ev</a> had come up with. We all knew Ev from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogger</a> and he &amp; Biz had worked together on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeo">Odeo</a> (a podcasting service that was <em>way</em> before its time) too. Together, under the moniker “Obvious Corp.”, they had just rolled out a new messaging service called “Twttr” (because who needs vowels). It later spun out of Obvious Corp. as “Twitter”.</p>

<p>Twitter filled a very interesting niche for me back in those days, but I didn’t really notice how much until we all returned to SXSW in 2007. When we had regrouped in 2006, we had spent a lot of time catching up on the developments in our lives that had taken place in the intervening year (at least those we hadn’t blogged about). 2007, however, was different.</p>

<p>By the time SXSW rolled around in March of that year, we’d all been actively using Twitter for nearly six months. And because so few people were on Twitter at the time <em>and</em> we all followed each other, it was quite easy to keep up-to-date with what was going on in everyones’ lives. Twitter created this sort of <em>ambient awareness</em> of everything important that was going on with the folks in the group. So when we returned to Austin in March of 2007, we didn’t spend any time catching up on the events of the intervening year because we didn’t need to. We already knew and were able to pick right up as though we hadn’t missed a beat. It was a pretty amazing feeling and played a big part in my falling in love with Twitter.</p>

<p>That love affair continued for years. My relationships with my friends deepened and our collective relationship with Twitter deepened. I don’t think anything illustrates that more than my good friends <a href="https://twitter.com/stefsull">Stephanie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/garazi">Greg</a> getting engaged via the service (yes, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/03/true-story-of-a/">they were the first</a>):</p>

<hr />

<p>In the past decade, Twitter has changed dramatically. Most of us, with the exception of <a href="https://twitter.com/briansuda">Brian</a>, moved away from tweeting in the third person. Here’s my transition (circa 2012… I tweeted for nearly 6 years in the third person!):</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">has decided, after much internal debate &amp; consideration of your thoughts, to abandon 3rd person tweeting style. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/3pT?src=hash">#3pT</a> will be the transition.</p>&mdash; Aaron Gustafson (@AaronGustafson) <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson/status/258639664947273729">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You are confused and confounded by this move and wonder why <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson">@aarongustafson</a> did it. Perplexed, you scratch your head.</p>&mdash; Aaron Gustafson (@AaronGustafson) <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson/status/258639921940688896">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When it came down to it, I decided it was about you, my readers, more so than my enjoyment of the mental exercise of writing 3rd person.</p>&mdash; Aaron Gustafson (@AaronGustafson) <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson/status/258640188631310336">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The truth is that while I love writing and 3rd person was fun, this change will let me play with other authoring styles.</p>&mdash; Aaron Gustafson (@AaronGustafson) <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson/status/258640798663454720">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></p>

<p>Ideas we played with, like <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412">Chris’ suggestion that we add tagging to our tweets</a>, <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/twitter-syntax#Messages">“d” messages</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rsa/status/55281">at-mentions</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericrice/status/31669791">Retweets</a> (later, <a href="https://twitter.com/TDavid/status/641334922">RTs</a>) changed from things we did as a matter of necessity while using the service to integral pieces of “Twitter the Platform”.</p>

<p>In the past decade, the culture of Twitter has also changed. When we were starting out, there was this great feeling of solidarity, togetherness. Twitter was a huge public commons where we were all friendly and respectful, even when we disagreed. In the intervening years (the last few perhaps even moreso), however, Twitter has become this wedge that seems to be driving our society apart. The decisive, bile-and-hatred fueled posts, rampant bigotry, threats of violence, and gross intolerance has become such a downer that each year I pull back a little more. I don’t browse the public stream anymore; I can’t deal with it. I have reduced the number of people I follow and have become more dependent on lists and tools like <a href="http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> and <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">TweetDeck</a> to help me identify the shallows of Twitter I’m interested in wading into. Don’t get me wrong, Twitter still manages to prove its value every now and again. It can absolutely be a force for good, but like so many things that work well in their ideal state, us messy humans have come along and fucked it all up.</p>

<p>In the past decade, Twitter itself has also fundamentally changed. I remember being gobsmacked when I visited the service’s ginormous San Francisco headquarters last year and saw the massive number of people working there. It made me pine for the days when I used to duck out of Adaptive Path’s SoMa office two grab lunch with the 12 (!) people who were running Twitter at the time. Twitter looks all grown up, but to me it still seems like it’s going through a painful adolescence, unsure of what it wants to be. I hope it can find its way, but I’m uncertain if our relationship will survive that.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ten years in, I am still in love with Twitter, but I’m unsure if that love is for the service it has become or if it’s simply a manifestation of my nostalgia. I guess time will tell.</p>

<p><em>Jeremy Keith also recently celebrated his first decade on Twitter. You should definitely read <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/11436">his thoughts &amp; recollections too.</a></em></p>

<p><a href="#fig-2016-10-11-1">This is my son Oscar</a>. In case you can’t see the picture, he looks nothing like me because he’s adopted. He’s also friggin’ adorable, but that’s not why I’m writing this. I’m writing this because my son is black and despite the fact that he will grow up in a family that has the means to provide him with a good education and far more opportunity than a lot of children in America—including me—the sheer fact that his skin is dark means he will grow up in a far different America than I did.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/shopping-while-black-americas-retailers-know-they-have-racial-profiling-problem-now-2222778">He will be suspected when he enters a store</a>. <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/teaching_now/2016/03/bias.html">He will be treated differently in school</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/us/heres-how-racial-bias-plays-out-in-policing.html">He will be policed differently</a>. If he commits a crime, he will be <a href="http://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/raceinc.html">six times more likely to be incarcerated</a> than his white friends in daycare; and if it’s a drug offense, he’ll be <a href="http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Race_and_Prison">ten times more likely to serve time</a>.</p>

<p>He will be feared by default. He will be suspected by default. He will be guilty by default. All because he’s black.</p>

<p>I don’t want him to grow up in an America where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile">he could have his life ended during a traffic stop for a broken tail light</a>. I listened to Diamond Reynolds’ recording of Philando Castile dying and I had to stop the car and cry; I couldn’t bear to watch the video. He was someone else’s son. Someone else’s little boy.</p>

<p>This is not the America I want Oscar to grow up in and we have an opportunity to change it. I fully recognize that <a href="http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/docs/kerner.pdf">the societal issues that underly the way we (as a nation) treat the black community</a> and other people of color in the U.S. are not new, nor are they going to go away overnight. It’s going to take time and commitment to making it happen.</p>

<p>What I also know, however, is that electing a president who proposes <a href="http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/08/trumps-immigration-policies-follow-historical-racist-precedents/">racist policies</a>, uses <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/06/21/racist-comments-federal-judge-hurt-donald-trump-florida-ohio/86172262/">racist rhetoric</a>, and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-paints-apocalyptic-picture-of-racial-tensions-in-u-s/">gins up racial tensions</a> among his supporters is not going to make America a safer place for Oscar to grow up. A man who <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/editorials/article99304487.html">routinely derides and demonizes immigrant populations</a> of varying shades (despite marrying numerous immigrants himself) is not going to lead us to be a more inclusive nation. And a man who has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/is-donald-trump-a-racist.html">a history of treating the black community unfairly</a> is not going to be the champion we need to help unify our different racial and ethnic communities into that melting pot of ideas and cultures we’ve been taught is America’s greatest strength.</p>

<p>When I go to the polls this Fall to help my country choose its next leader, I will be thinking of my son and all of the other children in this great nation of ours. I will think about the future America they stand to inherit and I will vote against Donald Trump. I hope you will join me in taking a stand against fear, against further segregation of our society, and against racism. America is already great, and it will be much better without Trump.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/what-are-keys-to-success/"/>
    <updated>2016-06-01T11:18:31-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/what-are-keys-to-success</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I got a message from someone I’ve been mentoring via email. His question was one I think a lot of folks in our industry struggle with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you please tell what are keys to success and what should I do to become a successful programmer and software engineer? Anything is appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- more -->

<p>That’s a tough one. “Success” can be defined in so many ways. Is success making truckloads of money? Is it having 100,000 Twitter followers? Is it getting invited to speak at conferences in exotic locations? Those are very external notions of success, perhaps it’s more personal: Feeling like you’ve accomplished what you set out to do. Feeling like your life has meaning. Finding joy in both your work and your play. With so many ways to define success, there’s no magic formula for achieving it.</p>

<p>Unsure how to answer this perplexing question, I decided to answer by sharing what makes me feel successful—the Golden Rule. I used the Islamic version in my response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That I chose the Islamic version had more to do with where my protege resides than anything else. This concept is universal, cropping up in nearly every faith and philosophy as well as in numerous cultural proverbs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blessed is he who preferreth his brother before himself. (Baha’i)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One should seek for others the happiness one desires for one’s self. (Buddhism)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. (Chrisitianity)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try your best to treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself and you will find that this is the shortest way to benevolence. (Confucianism)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He sought for others the good he desired for himself. Let him pass on! (Egyptian)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t go around hurting people, and Try to understand things. (Hopi)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humanists acknowledge human interdependence, the need for mutual respect and the kinship of all humanity. (Humanism)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In happiness and suffering, in joy and grief, we should regard all creatures as we regard our own self. (Jainism)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One going to take a pointed stick to pinch a baby bird should first try it on himself to feel how it hurts. (Nigerian)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do as you would be done by. (Persian)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there’s my personal favorite, from Judaism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man. That is the entire law; all the rest is commentary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Golden Rule is a wonderful tool for helping maintain balance in your life, business, and relationships. And so, I followed this recommendation proverb with a bit more detail on how I feel we can embody this philosophy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Treat others with respect (means respecting their time, dignity, etc.).</li>
  <li>Look for opportunities to help others accomplish <em>their</em> goals.</li>
  <li>Give of yourself freely without expecting return.</li>
</ul>

<p>My twelve years of Catholic schooling drummed the proverb “to whomever much is given, much will be required“ into my head, which accounts for my emphasis on sharing. I know that my “success”—as I define it at least—has been made possible by the generosity of others. And so I think it’s my duty to “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223897/">pay it forward</a>” and I look for every opportunity to create opportunities for others.</p>

<p>In my experience, living life this way—or at least improving on it a bit each day—makes me feel successful. Perhaps it will work for you as well.</p>

<p><em>Note: Passing along this tiny bit of wisdom made me feel successful today :-)</em></p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/apple-support-honeybadger/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-26T17:34:17-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/apple-support-honeybadger</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My iPhone fell clumsily out of my pocket when I was sitting down in the kitchen the other day. <em>Thwack!</em> It fell face-first onto the tile from my seated position a mere 18 inches up. Of course the screen cracked. Protective case be damned, the cracks spread across the screen like a spider web cast from razor blades.</p>

<p>I was crestfallen.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Thankfully, apart from the very finger-unfriendly hellscape the screen had become, the rest of the phone completely functional. If I was careful where and how I swiped, I could do pretty much anything I needed to. And I did exactly that for a few days while I looked into my options for fixing it.</p>

<p>It was an iPhone 6 I purchased right when they came out, so a warranty repair was not an option. And I don’t see the point of paying for phone insurance or Apple Care<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, so I was on my own to cover the cost of the repair. No biggie; it was my fault for putting it in the loose pocket of my pajama pants anyway.</p>

<p>I began researching my options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I could cover the broken phone with a rugged case and just deal with it.</li>
  <li>I could use one of our old iPhones until the next version came out.</li>
  <li>I could upgrade my phone with AT&amp;T.</li>
  <li>I could self-repair as <a href="http://www.imore.com/iphone-6-screen-replacement-how-to">the process is pretty straightforward</a>, but in talking with a friend who repairs smartphones for a living, I discovered the replacement screens weren’t that great.</li>
  <li>I could have Apple repair it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apple offers screen repair for $109, which isn’t too bad, but that takes a few days to ship the phone back and forth. They offer an expedited option where they just send you a new phone, but at $299, it seemed silly.</p>

<p>I contacted the local authorized Apple repair center to see if they could do the repair, but it turns out that they would just be sending it on to Apple anyway, so it seemed like my best bet would be to go back to the source. After all, who could know better how to replace a broken iPhone screen (<a href="https://www.etechparts.com/lcd-screen-and-digitizer-full-assembly-with-small-parts-black-for-iphone-6.html">and digitizer, since they’re fused</a>) than Apple Support?</p>

<p>I chatted with an Apple Support rep about doing the repair and confirmed that the repair would cost $109. The rep told me, however, that they would need to authorize my card for $299—the out-of warranty replacement cost—in case they discovered other damage to the phone. I agreed (it was my only option) with the understanding that Apple would run some diagnostic utilities to determine what (if any) additional issues the phone might have.</p>

<p>A day or two later I got the mailer to send the phone to Apple, I shipped it to them and waited. They confirmed receipt of the phone the next day and, two days later, I got an email saying the phone was en route back to me. I was thrilled with the quick turnaround!</p>

<p>Then Kelly asked me why Apple had charged us $329. I said I wasn’t sure. The authorization was for $299, but the repair service was only supposed to be $109 (plus tax and shipping, naturally). Perhaps they billed the whole amount and then returned the unused portion in a separate transaction. We decided to wait and see what would happen.</p>

<p>The next day, a phone arrived. I say <em>a</em> phone because it was not <em>my</em> phone. Apple Support had sent me a refurbished replacement phone and charged me the full replacement cost. <em>Why?</em> “After thorough diagnostic testing, it has been determined that a replacement iPhone (enclosed) is necessary.” Vague.</p>

<p>I was curious what their tests had revealed. <span data-quotable="">What gremlins were lurking in my heretofore fully-functional device?</span> I decided to investigate with another support rep and was not thrilled with what I found.</p>

<p><em>Note: I spent the next few hours in a chat session with two different reps at Apple Support. Both were incredibly friendly and did everything in their power to help me get to the bottom of why my screen repair had turned into a complete replacement. Credit where credit is due.</em></p>

<p>In the conversation with the first rep, Josh, I made it clear that the phone was working perfectly before I sent it to them. It merely needed a new screen/digitizer. I offered that I was disappointed to see that they’d replaced it without explaining what would require that level of remediation <em>and</em> without giving me the option to have the phone returned to me as-is. From the beginning, he clearly saw where I was coming from:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh good grief, I’m really sorry you’ve had to deal with this. That’s not at all what we want from this process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a few minutes of doing some research, he came back to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So basically from what we’ve been discussing, the service center does run a plethora of tests on the phone once it’s sent in. That’s to be sure that it’s working properly in all ways, rather than just the screen repair itself, though trust me, I do fully understand that the only thing you wanted was the screen to be repaired, so I’m just compiling all of the data to see what happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few minutes later…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]t’s looking like basically what ended up happening was there were tests that were run which will test the phone for a bit of additional damage than the tests that were run. From there, they look into what will give you the longest lasting phone, basically so that you don’t run into an issue with what their diagnostics tests detected down the road, and then need to pay again for it to be repaired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I replied</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[That] assumes I plan to keep the phone long enough for it to become an issue… I appreciate them looking into potential issues, but making unilateral decisions about how to proceed is not good customer service in my opinion. Letting someone know what the issue is and how much the repair would cost is just common courtesy. Even my car dealership does me that courtesy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Josh was right there with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exactly, which I know is not always a proper assumption, and I can entirely agree. I’m even still looking into additional data for you. I really don’t like how this was handled, so I’m seeing if I can come across anything additional on the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He asked if I knew of any other damage to the phone and I told him that it was always in a case and I was not aware of a single other issue with the phone, cosmetic or otherwise.</p>

<p>He was completely empathetic:</p>

  <p>I’m really sorry about this whole thing, Aaron. It’s looking like some sort of damage was found with the phone, which is what caused that price to be charged, rather than just the screen repair, so ultimately they decided that it would give you a longer lasting phone to replace it, so that way you wouldn’t have to deal with the hassle of having additional issues down the road. Honestly, I cannot express enough how much I understand the situation, and especially at least being informed or asked if that can be done. That’s just why the full out of warranty/replacement charge has to be held initially, is so that they have authorization to run those tests, and if needed, replace it, rather than just repair it. I’m so sorry that the process wasn’t elaborated to you, and that they didn’t at least let you know of what was going on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I reiterated that someone really should have <em>asked</em> if I wanted the additional work done. I understand Apple’s “heart” might be in the right place, but they failed to do what I had hired them to do. They didn’t consider my wishes or expectations in their process at all. Nor did they give me an opportunity to decline the replacement and get my broken phone back.</p>

<p>Josh pleasantly informed me that by agreeing to the repair, I was out of luck:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Replacement] was actually authorized to be used when you initially setup the payment. When the full $299 (plus taxes and shipping) was held from your card, that was authorized that if needed, it could be used for the repair if additional damage was found. Since it was found, they used the remainder of that money to replace the phone instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I countered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I understand that you required the $299 + tax in order to start the repair, but that was my only option if I wanted you guys to do the $109 screen repair. Like I said, had I suspected anything else was going to be done to the phone, I would have taken my chances buying a replacement screen and doing the repair myself. … I typically replace my phone every other version, so I would have limped along with the broken screen even rather than pay the full replacement fee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Josh, to his credit, was still on my side:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Right, trust me, I fully understand, or alternatively we could have taken it into the local Apple Authorized Service Provider, which would have been able to diagnose the phone as well in order to determine what had to be done, and then give you a price right then and there. … I’ve actually covered cracked screens in cling wrap so that I didn’t need to risk furthering the damage, or hurting myself. I can also fully understand the process of not expecting that there was any further damage, since you were able to sue the phone just fine, and that’s why you ended up getting it setup that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, however, it didn’t really matter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, again, as much as I wish there was something that could be done on the matter in order to basically reverse what happened, it’s just not possible. Since it was authorized when it was initiated, and I do see where the previous advisors let you know that the full charge would be taken if additional damage was found, but if the only damage found to the phone was the screen cracks, then all but the screen repair fee of $109 plus taxes and shipping would be reimbursed. It’s just that additional damage was found, which is what caused that full charge to be taken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a bit more back-and-forth, Josh recommended I file a complaint with Apple (I have), said he would make sure the process was reviewed internally, and connected me with a Senior Advisor, Alexander, to help me get a few more details regarding the “damage” that prompted the replacement. I thanked him for his time and for his empathy toward my situation.</p>

<p>The next few minutes involved getting Alexander up to speed with what had happened. He was equally helpful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Okay, I know how a sudden cost like this $299 can be concerning, especially when you don’t feel adequately informed on the situation. I can certainly clarify anything and get this figured out with you though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then he dropped the bombshell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the main bit of information that I want to address is not that the phone was replaced to address issues that may arise down the road. In this case, a screen replacement was attempted and did not yield a functioning device. When that occurs, our only option is to replace the device. I do see from your chats with Michelle and Teresa that they advised this was the procedure that we have</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Wait. What?!</em> They didn’t find any problems. In replacing the screen, the tech bricked the phone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, not at all. Just that they were unable to have a fully functioning unit after a screen replacement. That does not mean that the tech bricked the phone or messed up when replacing the screen, it means the phone was not able to work after the screen was replaced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um, sounds to me like they bricked my phone. Alexander tried to clarify, but was ultimately saying the same thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the issue was only a cracked screen, that does not mean that the screen can be replaced and yield a functioning device. Unfortunately we can never know if a screen replacement will work until we try.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So… iPhones are only <em>occasionally</em> repairable. In other words, it’s a crapshoot. Comforting. No one had mentioned that they could brick the phone when attempting to repair it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was never advised that the repair could yield a non-functioning device. This is even more strange than I expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alexander towed the company line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m looking at the chats you had with us when setting up the repair, and both advisors did say how it could be $299. I also don’t see anything from either one that says the depot would reach out to you if the repair price was not going to be $109. I’m really sorry that this happened to you Aaron, but this is how our process works and everything looks to have been done correctly here. … I see them saying that they will attempt to replace the screen and if that works it would be a $109 repair. If there were additional issues, it would cost more up to the $299 max for a full replacement unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I clarified that they had said it <em>could</em> cost more. There’s a difference between “could” and “would”. I mentioned that I could have just kept the broken phone and upgraded with AT&amp;T and spent less money. Alexander didn’t miss a beat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That certainly was an option you could have taken Aaron, and I do sympathize with not taking that option to end up paying more than you expected. I really wish the repair process was clearer for you, and I can only advise that you leave some feedback about the repair process to us at Apple Feedback. I don’t see any mention in these chats of the depot contacting you if the cost would be more nor an advisor stating that would be the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I stuck to my guns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I agree they didn’t state that would happen, but I think in the repair world it’s pretty common. … Explicitly stating that would not happen might be a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alexander conceded that the process was less than ideal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t disagree, but that does vary from place to place and device to device. Our procedures are in line with most of the mobile phone world on this though. I will certainly leave some feedback for those advisors to be more clear about this process when a repair is set up though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We talked for a few more minutes, but it was clear I was out of options. I could file a complaint with Apple (and have), but I am skeptical they even pay attention to that stuff. I know they don’t chime in on their own forums. My only other option was to share my story with you, in hopes you might avoid a similar situation.</p>

<p>So consider yourself warned: If you send your phone to Apple for something as simple as a screen repair, they just may brick your phone and charge you for the convenience. Oh and the replacement phone only has a 90-day warranty. <em>Hooray!</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monday, February 2nd will be the start of a new chapter in my professional career: I will joining Microsoft as a standards evangelist.</p>

<p><em>Wha?!</em></p>

<p>The reasons for the move are manifold, but I will do my best to summarize by taking you on the journey I’ve been on and hopefully that will help you understand why I will be leaving agency life behind and joining a browser maker (and the makers of Internet Explorer at that).</p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p>I’ve been working on the Web since 1996. That’s nearly 20 years of building everything from simple marketing campaign sites to emails to complex transactional websites and custom content management systems. In that time, I’ve gained skills on both the front end and the back end and rolled the 10,000 hour odometer at least a couple of times.</p>

<p>It’s been great. I love building things and I love helping our amazing clients put awesome information and services on the Web. But at the same time, I’ve enjoyed working with teams to help <em>them</em> solve their own problems even more than I’ve enjoyed solving them directly. It’s why I love speaking at conferences and running workshops: I love to see the lightbulbs come on over people’s heads!</p>

<p>Over the last few years, <a href="http://easy-designs.net">Kelly and I</a> have made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of production work we’ve been doing in favor of more consulting. And early last year we came to a sort of crossroads: We knew we could keep doing what we’d been doing and things would be good, but we weren’t feeling challenged anymore.</p>

<p>And so we began to brainstorm ideas of what we’d like to do in the next phase of our lives.</p>

<hr />

<p>Kelly came to the Web from an education and community organizing background, so she wanted to find a way to incorporate those with her technical knowledge. And about two months ago, she got that opportunity and she took a position as the Program Manager for <a href="http://techgoeshomecha.org/">Tech Goes Home Chattanooga</a>, an organization committed to bridging the digital divide in our fair city.</p>

<p>When I close my eyes and think about what makes me happiest, it’s writing, speaking, and spreading the word about web design best practices. The folks I know who get to do that full-time tend to be developer evangelists (or <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a>). And so I began pondering that possibility.</p>

<p>As I went through the list of browser makers in my mind, Microsoft stuck out.</p>

<p>Some of you might think that’s odd. I mean come on, IE has been the red-headed stepchild of the web design world for the better part of a decade. Why on earth would I want to work there?</p>

<p>Well, I’ll tell you: Despite its market largesse, IE (and in many ways Microsoft) is operating like the scrappy upstart. And I root for underdogs.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think back to the early days of the Web when I would need a Windows license for every virtual machine I wanted to run in order to test each browser version. It was a pain in the ass and made me curse Microsoft on a regular basis.</p>

<p>But things have changed. A lot.</p>

<p>A few years back, the IE team launched <a href="http://modern.ie">modern.IE</a>, an awesome resource with VMs that were free for the taking. They also launched <a href="https://www.modern.ie/en-us/report">a free tool for identifying coding issues and checking cross-browser interoperability</a>. Then they opened up <a href="http://status.modern.ie">the roadmap for standards implementations in IE</a>. And just recently they gave us <a href="https://remote.modern.ie/">RemoteIE</a> and did away with the need for VMs altogether (at least to test our stuff on the latest version of IE).</p>

<p>This is a very different Microsoft.</p>

<p>Now sure, there’s still more they could open up, but this is progress. Big ships are slow to turn, but this ship is turning.</p>

<p>I want to be a part of that.</p>

<hr />

<p>I will be joining Microsoft as a “Senior Program Manager”, but titles don’t matter much to me. I see my job boiling down to a few key things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Helping web designers and developers better understand the possibilities of the Web;</li>
  <li>Advocating for interoperable, accessible web design best practices;</li>
  <li>Being a voice for the web design and development community to communicate their needs to the IE team in order to improve the browser; and</li>
  <li>Being an internal advocate for Web standards implementations in other Microsoft products (think Visual Studio, Outlook, Word).</li>
</ol>

<p>Microsoft is not hiring me to be a salesman—<em>thank god, they’d be pretty disappointed</em>—they are hiring me to continue being me. I will continue writing, I will continue speaking, and I will continue educating. The only thing that has changed is that I can spend all of my time doing that, rather than having to balance it with client work.</p>

<hr />

<p>So Monday starts a new chapter in my career. It’s a little scary (I haven’t worked for someone else for over a decade), but it is also exciting. I am comforted by the fact that I am joining an amazing team: As he announced yesterday, <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/2015/01/29/on-towards-my-next-challenge-2/">Christian Heilmann will also join Microsoft on the 2nd</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAIPCp_BOGU">charismatic Rey Bango</a> will be leading our merry little conga line.</p>

<p>I’m excited about the future and I’m thrilled to be given the opportunity to focus on making the Web better… for everyone.</p>
