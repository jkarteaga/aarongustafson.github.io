    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the work that we do on the Web (as well as in our daily lives), we’re often confronted, informed, or judged based on averages. I never really stopped to think about it, beyond being bugged by the fact that averages aren’t truly representative of reality. Then I listened to <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-average/">99% Invisible’s episode “On Average”</a>. It was incredibly enlightening and the stories shared in that episode provide sage wisdom that is very relevant to the work that we do.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Do you know where our fascination with averages began? It all started with Adolphe Quételet, a Belgian mathematician and astronomer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the 1830s, astronomers were some of the only people that regularly calculated averages, since early telescopes were extremely imprecise. To obtain more accurate data for say, tracking the orbits of planets, astronomers would take multiple measurements (all of which were slightly different) add them together, then divide by the number of observations to get a better approximation of the true value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quetelet decided to apply this tool to people, starting with Scottish soldiers’ chest sizes. Turns out the average chest size of a Scottish soldier in the 1830s was 39.75 inches. File that one away for Pub Trivia.</p>

<p>Quetelet believed that the average was the “true” size of something… something that we should strive for or that nature would attempt to create. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_idealism">Platonic ideal</a> if you will:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Quetelet’s mind, human averages had a certain moral mandate. By his logic, if everyone were optimally fed and lived under the same environmental conditions, they would be average. And this is what society should be striving for: the continual improvement of the average of the group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We look at averages all the time in our work. Some, like average <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive">Time To Interactive (TTI)</a>, are useful measurements that allow us to improve our work; others, like the “average” user are decidedly less so. <span data-quotable="">The “average” person (or dog or flower) is a myth. Everyone and everything is unique to some equally unique degree.</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_second">Even mass-produced objects have variance</a>.</p>

<p>Designing for the “average” user is incredibly problematic. The episode I mentioned captured this perfectly in a story about the U.S. Army’s design of airplane cockpits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]n 1926, when the Army designed its first airplane cockpit, they measured the physical dimensions of male pilots and calculated the average measurement of their height, weight, arm-length and other dimensions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The results determined the size and shape of the seat, the distance to the pedals and the stick, and even the shape of the flight helmets. This mean that, in part, pilots were selected based on their ability to fit into the cockpit designed for the average 1920s man.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This worked more or less up until World War II, when the Army began recruiting hundreds of new pilots to expand its air forces (which became a separate branch of the military in 1947). But with the birth and expansion of the Air Force came a decline in performance and a rash of deaths. Even with no war, pilots continued to die during training, as they were unable to control their planes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The high death rate in the Air Force was a mystery for many years, but after blaming the pilots and their training programs, the military finally realized that the cockpit itself was to blame, that it didn’t actually fit most pilots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1950, the Air Force sent Gilbert S. Daniels out to collect ten measurements from thousands of airmen—yes, they were all men at the time—across the U.S. in order to establish a new average. After collecting the data, Daniels got curious and decided to see how many of the airmen he measured hit the average on all ten measurements. Not a single one. How about three of the measurements? Less than five percent. He realized that <span data-quotable="">in designing for an average, they were, in fact, designing for no one.</span> Based on this discovery, the Air Force commissioned new equipment that including features like adjustable foot pedals, helmet straps, flight suits, and seats. And, wonder of wonders, pilot performance improved dramatically.</p>

<p>When we design, we need to be cognizant of the variety of human experience and plan accordingly. <span data-quotable="">For our work to be successful, we need to accommodate the adjustments our users require for <em>them</em> to be successful.</span> Responsive layouts, adaptive interfaces, support for assistive technologies… all of these approaches enable our work to go further by enabling it to be tailored to the permanent, temporary, and/or situational needs of our users.</p>

<p>All of this is to say, this episode made me an even more ardent believer in the idea of <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive enhancement</a> and the continuum of experience it enables. You should go listen to it now, I promise there’s more to the story.</p>

    <updated>2014-07-17T08:21:47-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/native-vs-stylable-tug-of-war</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In his astute post <a href="//www.brucelawson.co.uk/2014/native-experience-vs-styling-select-boxes/">“‘Native experience’ vs styling select boxes”</a>, Bruce Lawson correctly identified a common tension in the web world:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But why this urge to re-style page elements that end-users are familiar with? … Or is it that we love native look and feel, except when we don’t?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking as the guy who not only wrote JavaScript to help me create an accessible <code>select</code> element alternative, but who also made it <a href="http://d1b14unh5d6w7g.cloudfront.net/1590598563.01.S0ER.LXXXXXXX.jpg?Expires=1405686346&amp;Signature=DCT4Z0l75JQESDNyP0PVGVonuJYwY9XYtaTI3grX/RhdlLcXGRAVADJCB/N/fAj7GxLhEVzuXqstMebJIJ9Ip5I6kE7IKYt2F20F5EGD+1ghua9zKwyjS1e4KBgumMKzQytbcfIVX4dMr7XFzj26mScFKz9bSKtZT5jU1LU6hWM=&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUO27P366FGALUMQ">the focus of a case study (image)</a> in <a href="http://amzn.to/TaoffD">AdvancED DOM Scripting</a>, I am fully aware of the desire to have it both ways. I have not often seen the desire for both in a single individual, but it does happen in one particular instance occasionally.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Based on my own experience, I see the following arguments in favor of changing the display of a native control quite often:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It doesn’t look good to me.</li>
  <li>It is not “on brand”.</li>
  <li>It clashes with our brand’s color scheme.</li>
  <li>We want the web experience to feel like a native app.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t behave how we think it should.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>(<abbr lang="it" title="nota bene: please note">n.b.</abbr> Browsers have done a pretty good job reducing the amount of color and the overall visual strength used in native controls to help them better blend in with a wide variety of designs, so clashes as mentioned in #3 happen far less often than they did nearly a decade ago.)</em></p>

<p>As the weathered, battle tested (and, admittedly, somewhat jaded) front-end dev that I am, I typically push back with one or more of the following:</p>

<h2 id="in-addressing-desired-design-changes">In Addressing Desired Design Changes</h2>

<p>In terms of aesthetics (addressing arguments 1, 2, and 3), I understand where you’re coming from. Native controls are not the most appealing things, but they are familiar to your users. A <code>select</code> box they see on your site that looks like the one they see on Wikipedia or their banking site will be immediately recognizable. Sure, the looks and feel may differ from browser to browser, but most people use only a small number of browsers throughout the day—at work, at home, on their device—and if you want to ensure the design of a form control feels “right” in the browser they are using, sometimes it’s best to let go of that control.</p>

<h2 id="in-addressing-os-parity">In Addressing OS Parity</h2>

<p>I can understand the desire to have a form control in a web page look and feel like the same (or a similar) control within the native operating system (argument 4), but I am not sure that’s a rabbit hole you want to go down. Here’s why: Achieving exact design and functional parity between a native control and a web control quite often requires extra markup, a bunch of CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Anything is achievable with unlimited time and budget, so it’s completely doable, but it would be good to estimate the cost to see if you still think it is a worthwhile endeavor.</p>

<p>Assuming it is, we then have the question of which operating system to model the control after. Or maybe you want to offer a different take on the control based on the operating system your user is using. In that case, we may need to multiply the original estimate by the number of operating systems you want to support. But it’s worth noting that, in the Android world, different device manufacturers often “skin” the operating system to look different from other ones. Sometimes they even do it on a device-by-device basis. We’ll need to figure out which ones you want to include in your native control matrix and multiply the estimate accordingly.</p>

<p>Then there’s maintenance. We’ll need to test these native-like controls on each of their corresponding platforms and test the script that determines which experience gets delivered to which device to make sure we’re not accidentally sending the wrong experience. We’ll also need to test the delivery script on every other browser in our test matrix to ensure it is not causing issues there.</p>

<p>What should we do when a new operating system version is rolled out? iOS, for example, has made radical shifts in the design of their native controls in each major release. We’ll probably want to create unique versions of the control for each version of each OS we support and we’ll need to keep tabs on upgrades so we don’t end up confusing our users if they visit our site in iOS 7 and have a control that looks like it’s from iOS 6. We’ll need to add the number of OS versions into the multiplier as well.</p>

<p>Ok, and finally: How many controls did you want to apply this approach to again?</p>

<p>Or we could use the native form control and it will just work.</p>

<h2 id="in-addressing-altered-behavior">In Addressing Altered Behavior</h2>

<p>I completely agree that not all native controls work exactly how I would like, but there are several risks in changing the expected behavior of a native control.</p>

<p>First of all, there’s the possibility we could actually end up making the interface more confusing or that the change in behavior might not be exactly what our user’s wanted (either based on what they are used to or our mental model not aligning with theirs). In order to rule out these issues, we should run a few rounds of usability tests. These could be quick café tests or more formal studies depending on the budget.</p>

<p>Assuming our tests go well, we will need to maintain this code and do all of the requisite browser testing. And potentially upgrade our code as new browsers and browser versions come out. Depending on the complexity of the code, this could become a large requirement, but if it is ultimately in the service of making the web a better, more usable interaction environment, it could be worth it.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, if we go this route and are successful, we should consider getting involved in the spec-writing process at the <a href="//w3.org">W3C</a> or  <a href="//whatwg.org">WhatWG</a>. We should contribute our recommended changes back to the community and share what we learned. If we make a compelling argument, perhaps our idea will become part of some future standard and we can taper off our browser testing when the change goes native.</p>

<hr />

<p>As you can probably tell, I’m not a really big fan of changing existing controls as I feel it can amount to a wasted effort. That said, if there are design improvements to be made—“design” in the true sense: being about how usable something is, not just how aesthetically-pleasing it is to someone (e.g. improving contrast, making the control more intuitive, etc.)—I’m willing to accept the change as something we <em>should</em> do and then work to make sure that change has been vetted and, if successful, given away for inclusion in other projects. If it solves a major issue on the web, I want to give that change every opportunity to make it into the appropriate spec by talking to the appropriate folks about it both in-person, in blog posts, and on the appropriate mailing list. If the change solves a problem in a specific browser, I want to see it incorporated into said browser and will file a bug report and try to build momentum around it by engaging the community.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s my general position on augmenting native controls. What are your thoughts on the topic?</p>
